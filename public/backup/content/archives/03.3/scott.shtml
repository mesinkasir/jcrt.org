<p><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/C.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="C" ALIGN="LEFT">ontemporary trends in American religion have long beenmoving away from traditional theology and ethics. A recent manifestation ofthis trend is that many people now prefer to call themselves 'spiritual' ratherthan 'religious.' The term, 'spiritual,' seems to mean that one is pursuing aself-determined spiritual journey grounded in authentic, private experience.This is in opposition to being 'religious,' which seems to mean that one issectarian by adhering to the practices and beliefs of a historicallyestablished religious tradition. 'Spiritual' people believe that privateexperience makes public theology and ethics at best redundant and at worstabhorrent –as being spiritual is to be more open, tolerant and authentic. Itfollows that 'spiritual' people have little knowledge and less need of thetheology and ethics that grounds the tradition in which they often, ostensiblyparticipate. Public theology is washed-out by the common denominator of privateexperience. It remains to be seen if this is a positive development for religion.</p>
<LI>One of the many recent offerings on the subject of neuroscience and religious belief, <i>Why God Won't Go Away</i>, by Newberg,D'Aquili and Rause, seems to legitimize these trends with the stamp ofscientific evidence. The authors find the alpha and omega of religion incertain brain states, which can be empirically observed with new brain scantechnology. However, do the bright colors on computer screens of brain scansshow us the essence of religion? Moreover, one might ask if popular trendsprovide the authors with a schema for interpreting the data, rather than thedata legitimizing these popular trends? Whatever, the answer to thesequestions, and I will briefly worry about them later, this recent book,subtitled, <i>Brain Science and the Biology of Belief</i>, is a good read. Itdoes not make high demands on either one's time or concentration. Moreover, forthose, like myself, not familiar with the exciting recent activity exploringthe relationship between brain science and some religious activities, this bookis an excellent place to start. It yields high returns for time spent.<P></LI>
<LI>In the first third of the book the authors describe their recent experiments and the current state of knowledge about brain mechanics andarchitecture. Along the way they briefly, but systematically, discuss how anunderstanding of these ideas inform their experiments on the brain andspirituality. These introductory chapters are good science writing for thecurious lay public. The next four chapters are devoted to meta-scientificspeculations about what can be inferred from brain science about the nature andorigins of myth making, rituals, mysticism, and religion in general. In thepenultimate chapter the authors speculate on the reality of mysticalexperiences, and, in the ultimate chapter they reveal the essence of religionfrom the view of brain science.<P></LI>
<LI>Excluding the first three chapters, most of the book is what Karl Popper would call pseudo-science, or more accurately, meta-scientific(metaphysical) speculations made in the guise of science. Such speculation canreveal legitimate insights. However, to avoid confusion about what warrants aparticular assertion, distinctions should be made between scientific assertionsand metaphysical ones. At times the authors are careful to qualify theirmeta-scientific speculations as speculations. Unfortunately, like manyscientists who attempt to answer metaphysical questions, they are not alwaysdisciplined in making this distinction. With this caution in mind, the author'smeta-scientific speculations are provocative. For instance, the authors' makethe provocative claim that neuroscience reveals that the origin of allreligions is to be found in a continuum of brain states. This continuum ishierarchical and represents something like an ascent up Plato's line that leadsto a direct encounter with the "Absolute Unity of Being (162)." For Plato,enlightenment is noetic and requires decades of rigorous and systematiceducation to achieve. For Newberg, et al., enlightenment happens in the rangeof experiences one has during meditation or prayer as neural input decreases tothe orientation areas in the brain. The orientation areas are the parts of thebrain that create our sense of individuality or self. So, as neural input tothese areas decreases one loses one's sense of self. On rare occasions, duringintense spiritual exercise, the fundamental categories of self and not-self,which, again, are constructed by the orientation areas, dissolves as neuralinput to these areas completely shuts down. When this happens the spiritualpractitioner experiences the mystical oneness of Absolute Unity. The authorsdescribe this experience from the standpoint of brain science. They write:"There would be no discrete objects or beings, no sense of space or the passageof time, no line between self and the rest of the universe (119)."<P></LI>
<LI>The authors' most provocative claim is that this experience is an encounter with 'God.' Moreover, this experience is the groundof all spiritual reality and the beginning and end of all true religion. Theauthors write: "In [every religion]… the authority of that religion andessential realness of its God are rooted in transcendent experience of mysticalunion, whether mild or extremely powerful (139)." Later they continue thistheme: "When we realize that any specific conception of God is a piece of thislarger puzzle, rooted in a mystical understanding of what's fundamentally real,then all religions become siblings, all faiths become true, and allincarnations of God can be understood as real (162)."<P></LI>
<LI>While the authors argue that the encounter with 'God' can be explained in terms of brain architecture, mechanics and what happens toneural inputs during meditation and prayer, they want to say that thisexperience is nevertheless one of genuine transcendence (162). They in no waywant to be dismissive of the reality of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>'God'. Their basic argument for this claim is that those who have hadthis experience are sure that it is real, and moreover, we should take their wordfor this as there is something about such experiences that self-certify theirreality. Furthermore, these experiences are epistemically foundational forreligious truth. They point out, in an embarrassing comment, that "Aftercenturies of inquiry, philosophers have come to suggest that true realitypossess an unmistakable quality (152)." Wittgenstein, for example, does remarkin <i>On Certainty </i>that at times doubt makes no sense, but I am sure hewould have doubts about the above statement. The above statement is but one ofmany weaknesses in the story of religion from brain science. I will not attemptto make a list, but I would like to point out two obvious difficulties thatcaught my attention. One is that the authors frequently appeal to the theologicalpoint of <i>via negativa</i>. They approvingly cite mystics and theologians whoin various ways affirm <i>via negativa</i>: the position that God so transcendsthe human understanding that we can make no positive assertions about God'snature. Yet in one sentence the authors affirm that God's nature is unknowable,then in the next define God's essence. They write: "God is by natureunknowable… he is… being itself, the absolute, undifferentiated oneness that isthe ground of all existence (159)." These terms are not being usedmetaphorically, analogically or even ironically, in the manner of negativetheology. These are positive descriptions of the real experience oftranscendence when neural input is shut down to the orientation areas of thebrain.<P></LI>
<LI>The second difficulty concerns the authors' presumption that experience and interpretation can be neatly separated: the idea that thereis a foundational mystical experience that yields unmediated Truth. Moreover,the truth of that experience as the Absolute Unity of Being is affirmed bybrain science. The various religious schemas, or conceptual frameworks, used tointerpret the experience are superfluous, due to the self-certifying nature ofthe raw experience. Hence, all public theology, which is worked out in a tradition,dissolves in the face of the unmediated truth of the authentic spiritualexperience. However, there are considerable skepticisms that raw experience canbe made meaningful apart from an interpretive schema. Thomas Kuhn, for example,wonders if something like a paradigm, an interpretive framework, is aprerequisite for perception itself. In the absence of such a schema all wewould experience is William James' "bloomin' buzzin' confusion." The idea thatthere can be an unmediated, unitary spiritual experience that is foundationalto all religious truth is a dubious claim.<P></LI>
<LI>Finally, there is a danger that this story will, for some, seem to provide the stamp of scientific approval for reducing religion tospirituality and spirituality to private experience. Again, this makes thepublic theology found in religious traditions superfluous. Mystical experiencesare an essential part of religion, but they are not, as the authors' argue, itsessence. Experience without interpretation is meaningless; interpretationwithout experience is vacuous. So, to make an epistemological point: experiencecannot stand-alone. To make an ethical point: private religion is morallyirresponsible. That is, if religion is a purely private affair then there is noway to hold each other accountable for any crazy notion that might, and mostlikely will, pop into someone's head. Only in and through living traditions,where we share common vocabularies, concepts and schemas, can we argue aboutthe interpretive schemas that help provide meaning to experience. As AlasdairMacIntyre notes, to be part of a living tradition is to be confronted withrival interpretations of what it means to live out that tradition. So withinthe Islamic, Judaic and Christian traditions, for example, one finds rivalinterpretations about what it means to be a Muslim, Jew or Christian. It is only by making these interpretations public that we can argue about who we are, what we should do and what we should become.</LI>
