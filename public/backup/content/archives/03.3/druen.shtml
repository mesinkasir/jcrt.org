<p><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/P.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="P" ALIGN="LEFT">ain can be &quot;medicine, a test, a rite of passage, or an alchemical agent of inner transformation&quot; (210) and therefore sought with great passion.</P>

<LI>In conversation with a friend who had long suffered phantom pain and who wasaghast at the notion that any sane person would seek pain, Ariel Glucklichbegan to formulate a compelling thesis about what he calls sacred pain. The centerpiece of his thesis is thecontrast between the modern (perhaps mostly Western) view of pain as somethingto be avoided, treated, or escaped at all costs; and the traditional orreligious view that pain can be desirable and a vehicle for communing with thespiritual world. Specifically, heproposes that pain has a unique relation to identity. The distinction between the modern and traditional view of painhinges on the <i>desirability ofeliminating versus fortifying the self</i>. In both cases, pain is seen as something that can disrupt or fracturethe self: &quot;...pain weakens the individual's feeling of being a discreteagent; it make the 'body-self' transparent...&quot; (207). <P></LI>

<LI>For a modern person, a rupture in the selfis to be avoided as it would make it more difficult for the person to findmeaning in life, and, thus, pain is also to be avoided. For a mystic or traditional seeker, a breakin or emptying of the self is the path to spiritual connection, and thus, painis to be sought. In Glucklich's words:&quot;pain creates an embodied 'absence' and makes way for a new and greater'presence'.&quot; (207). Evidence forthis compelling thesis comes from disciplines as far ranging as social andGestalt psychology, anthropology, history, religion, and neuroscience. Such examples as rites of passage (typicallypublicly endured pain embedded in culture), self-mutilation (pain administeredprivately and usually experienced as releasing), and inquisition torture (painexplicitly inflicted to cast out sin) made the fine theoretical points comealive. Perhaps the most crucialcomponent of the book was the proposal and provision of support for amechanism, in this case neurological, which could account for the effects ofpain on spiritual connection and identity. &quot;The more irritation one applies to the body in the form of pain,the less output the central nervous system generates from the areas thatregulate the signals on which a sense of self relies.&quot; (207).<P></LI>

<LI>As a scholarly work, the book is a very fine accomplishment. Dr. Glucklich clearly outlined the scope ofthe argument, properly circumscribing the boundaries of coverage. He provided a wealth of information from high quality resource materials, including both fantastic case studies andfascinating research evidence. Importantly, he clearly elucidated and carefully avoided glossing overthe thorny details from the vast array of disciplines addressed. For example, the discussion of thebiological foundation of emotions was appropriately reflective of the state ofthe field. On the other hand, the ponderous wading through the theoretical andempirical minutia will certainly appeal only to sophisticated readers(particularly those whose disciplines are represented), and not at all to theaverage person, especially one who may be trying to find a way to cope withchronic pain. Glucklich doesacknowledge that his work was not aimed at providing relief or release to thosewith pain. <P></LI>

<LI>The work may be novelenough, perhaps even controversial enough, though, to prompt furtheradvances. His book may be a startingpoint for future discussions of the interrelationships among pain, perspectiveon pain, the self, and seeking the sacred. For example, people in pain, even in a culture that views pain as anultimate evil, may be able to translate some of the insights from this work totransform pain into their ally. Furtherdiscussion may productively address why some people choose pain as theirvehicle to reach union with the sacred over other methods, and whether thosemethods lead successfully to the same ends. The importance of consciouslydesiring a spiritual experience and having the belief that pain can helpachieve the experience should be investigated. The relation of self and pain may even be applied to other contexts. It may be possible, for instance, to applythese notions to understanding the self-hurting of those with autism. Finally, critics may well wonder whethermodern notions of pain can be bridged to, and in fact, if they really are sodistinct from the traditional. Afterall, &quot;No pain, No gain!&quot; is a championed slogan used to motivate orconsole those moving to achieve some valued goal. However, an evolution of this trite aphorism (also in rhyme) maybe something closer to &quot;Pain is a train&quot; that can take you places,even to a transcendent, higher realm of being.<p></LI>
