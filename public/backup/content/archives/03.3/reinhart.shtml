<p><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/W.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="W" ALIGN="LEFT">ithin this small but dense book, Jacques Derridaaddresses issues regarding social projects of legitimacy, hospitality, religionand politics. These essays are actuallycomprised of two separate speeches from 1996 and 1999.</p>
<LI>Once again, Derrida ably demonstrates his mastery of deconstruction. And once again, he illustrates why we need to be wary of thosewho all too easily label him either utopian or suspicious. Likewise, we need tobe wary of those who all too easily worship him or dismiss him. As usualDerrida resists being reduced to a formulaic spiral. <P></LI>
<LI>Derrida's first essay/speech, <i>Cosmopolitanism</i> provides an entry point into traditional European and especially French social virtue. It is a tradition at play for over twentycenturies, but Derrida questions this past in order to understand the presentstate and use of cosmopolitanism. LikeWalter Benjamin and Hannah Arendt whom he quotes here, he is primarily askingabout the nature of banality and the human ability to act inhumanely to otherswith whom they live. Derrida standswith these two seminal thinkers by continuing to point out the problem of banalitytoday, but states he desires to neither be overly suspicious nor utopian in hiscritique. He questions a European Unionwhich opens it's internal borders only to close its external borders. Likewise the actions of police who areallowed to control immigration and even deport legal aliens beyond the limitsof a legitimate police power. Yet thereis in all of this a certain recognition of the necessity of borders andpolice. The general question becomeswhat kind of borders, what kind of police are appropriate to <i>cosmopolitanism</i>?<P></LI>
<LI>A proposal is made for the establishment of Cities of Refuge, a proposal for the limitation of borders and police, what I would callan internalization of a border. Cities of Refuge are more than a traditionalnotion from times gone by, but a convergence of traditions within a concept asyet unfulfilled, an opening from which to think as well as to act withoutperversion of <i>the</i> law/right (<i>droit</i>)of hospitality. <P></LI>
<LI>This is neither a call for revolution nor evolution,neither a matter of newness nor progress, but rather a call for an opening from within which is a matter of recognition and decision. Derrida wants cosmopolitanism to be a traditional hospitality:more aware, more awake. If it is not, it becomes a banal triumphalism that again divides the foreigners fromfellow-citizens of the Saints. Ifcosmopolitanism can gain resources for renewal it will be in the recognition ofits wrong turns -- it must be a confessing cosmopolitanism.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One such wrong turn may be Immanuel Kant'sformulation of cosmopolitanism as natural law. As always, Kant is faced with the decision between unconditional andconditional aspects. In this case, it is cosmopolitanism. The unconditional is the "common possessionof the surface of the earth" while the conditional is that which is "<i>erected, constructed, or what sets itself up</i> above the soil: habitat, culture, institution, State, etc" (p.21). Because Kant decides upon this strictlydelimited condition he can then inscribe two paradigms, which counts inDerrida's eyes as some progress. But itis the decision to make this split where he does that politicizes allhospitality. The crux of the problemaccording to Derrida is that hospitality is made by Kant a sign dependent upon juridical notions of peace and thus then finally a matter of Statesovereignty. "Hospitality signifieshere the <i>public nature</i> of publicspace… hospitality, whether public or private, is dependent on and controlledby the law and the state police" (p.22).<P></LI>
<LI>&quot;<i>Forgiveness&quot;</i>is also an essay written to expose banality and question acts of memory with amaiutic intention. Derrida argues thatforgiveness in its purest form is an interruption of historical temporality,that it "<i>should not be,</i> normal, normative, or normalizing" (p.32). Forgiveness, when normed, when subsumed under historical time, closeshistory to history, in other words it is as much manipulation as history. What is history then? It is not just an act of memory. If history is a manifestation of anycurrency of meaning which can enable fair exchanges between memories, thenDerrida is calling for an organic historiography which enables multiple typesof exchanges of memory, an embrace of our own liminality without enforcinglimits on others. It is thus necessary forforgiveness not to be normalized or economized in a final way. >Maybe one could call this ade-eschatologization of forgiveness. Inany event, forgiveness needs be left open, aporetic, if humanity is to be givena chance to learn from the past. To saythat there is finally a correct way to forgive may have some good effectstemporarily but eventually leave others out. Derrida considers the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of SouthAfrica as an object lesson here. Thereis unprecedented healing taking place here and yet when forgiveness is givenconditionally in the name of justice, harm is done to justice itself. This is unavoidable anytime there is amediation of forgiveness, whether it is a language, a culture, or a state. The introduction of mediation is always anintroduction of a third, and that is a corruption of forgiveness itself. But, our experience of forgiveness can stillbe more or less pure. In this wayforgiveness, "must remain a madness of the impossible" (p.39)<P></LI>
<LI>Perhaps one of the most interesting questions performed by this short book, relates to the topics of cosmopolitanism and forgiveness themselves. Why were they chosen to be bound together here? In both essays Derrida questions socialinstitutions politically founded upon various circumstances such as TheInternational Criminal Court, E.U. immigration law, and the South African Truthand Reconciliation Commission mentioned above. It is another unfinished projectof modernity to reduce more traditional and organic understandings of asylumand territorial rights by their placement of these rights under conditional andeconomic constraints. Much of this is vintage Derrida, who reminds us againthat a society's foundations are always privileged: violent and colonial in the sense that the founding moment is a decision who is in, and who is outside. "The foundation is made in order to hide it; by its essence it tends to organize amnesia, sometimes under the celebration and sublimation of the grand beginnings" (p.57). <P></LI>
<LI>But this is not all that is contained here. Throughout both essays Derrida describes a <i>performance</i> -- what is <i>performed</i> in the "<i>project</i> of making States." These essays also describe what is performed in the project of creating legitimacy. Elsewhere, Derrida calls this unfinished project modernity -- of creating States and making legitimacy -- <i>closure</i>. And <i>closure</i> always calls for us to be vigilant.</LI>
