<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>...You think – because it is becoming plain to the modern eye that the ignorant love of his first followers wreathed his life in legend, that therefore you can escape from Jesus of Nazareth, you can put him aside as though he had never been? Folly! Do what you will, you cannot escape him. His life and death underlie our institutions as the alphabet underlies our literature.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/T.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="T" ALIGN="LEFT">he struggle to 'figure the Christ' through various means and media represents a continual search for not only the <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>content</i> of the figure in question (whatmakes up and makes possible this union of human and sacred) but ultimately the <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>form</i> within which this figuring is shownand understood. John McIntyre, in hisWarfield Lectures delivered at Princeton Theological Seminary, begins hisdiscussion of christology and christocentrism by employing a term not typicallyused in doctrinal discourse – <i>shape</i>.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As McIntyre rightly states, "if we wereasked to give in a summary form the distinguishing characteristic of Protestanttheology in our time, many of us would reply that it is its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>christocentric</i> quality which claims thistitle. And the evidence would beconvincing".</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="index.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> As McIntyre goes on to surmise:
<blockquote>It is by this time clear, then, that christology has come to exercisein theology a range of functions for which it was not originally designed: inthis range we find exegetical, expository and hermeneutical as well asnormative and critical elements… classical christology has come under severestrain in these new settings in which it has of late found itself and a crisishas begun to develop which can only be resolved by a radical reassessment ofthe basic <i>shape</i> of this centraldoctrine of the Christian faith as today expressed.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="index.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></blockquote>
McIntyre rightly notes that there is indeed a continued search forthe basic <i>shape</i> of this centraldoctrine of the Christian faith that is the nature of Christ and it goes backto the very foundations of the Church itself.

<P></LI><LI>As one turns to some ofthe earliest Christian writings, this quest for a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetics of Jesus</i> - how the form, content, and import of writingitself makes claims of 'ultimate concern'</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4'href="index.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>[4]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB> regarding the nature of Christ – we see particular attention paidto the ecumenical creeds. On theoccasion of the Council of Nicaea in CE 325, the dispute within the Churchregarding questions brought forward by the Arians as to the very form anddefinition of Christ's relation to God, gave rise to the need for apoetics. As the Arians argued in favourof a radical doctrine of monotheism, they in turn advocated a denial of Christas being <i>one </i>with God, but assertedhim to be <i>created </i>and therefore <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not of the same substance</i> as God. TheNicene Creed was drafted in response to this assertion. The actual <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetics</i> of the creed is presented in amanner to assert the orthodox stance of Christ as one who is 

<blockquote>only-begotten Son of God;<br>
Begotten of his Father before all worlds,<br>
God of God, Light of Light, Very God of VeryGod;<br>
Begotten, not made;<br>
Being of one substance with the Father;<br>
By whom all things were made...</blockquote>

Interestingly enough, the creed also presents a <i>condemnation</i>of those who did not 'fit' Christ into this shape. This is marked in the original form of the Nicene Creed whichconcludes with a portion originally added as an anathema against the Arians:"But to those who say: 'There is a time when He was not'; and 'He was not beforehe was made'; and 'He was made out of nothing,' or 'He is of another substanceor essence,' or 'The Son of God is created,' or 'changeable or alterable' –they are condemned by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church".</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="index.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span><span>[6]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Where a creed is to be an <i>assertion</i>of faith (the term coming from the Latin <i>credo</i>,"I believe") this original rendering stands as a statement <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>against</i> "I <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don't </i>believe" as much as a statement <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>for </i>certain beliefs.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The poetics thereby make claims thatoverturn the very definition of the genre itself (i.e. what constitutes <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Credo</i>) through its construction <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a work</i> and the claims it makes on howit is to be read. In this way, the <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetics</i> of the creed (and of muchliterature as I will argue throughout this essay) makes claims that at times aremore profound than the actual content or genre the work supposedlyrepresents.

<P></LI><LI>This elevation of poetics is exemplifiedregarding the further history of the ecumenical creeds in the Council ofChalcedon in CE 451, where the re-writing of the Nicene Creed as a response tosuch heresies as Arianism as well as Apollinarianism (the denial of the fullhumanity of Christ), Nestorianism<i> </i>(thedenial of the union of the two natures in Christ), and Eutycheanism (whichsought to deny the distinction of the two natures) rendered what is commonlyknown as the <i>Symbol of Chalcedon</i>.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The very form and limits within which theChurch can work out the orthodox doctrine of the person of Christ, is given inits poetics. As a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>symbol</i>, it operates as a <i>frame</i>within which all subsequent statements made regarding Christ can be seen – thatwhich falls outside the scope of its language and its intent is thereby outsidethe limits of expression regarding the person of Christ. Due to the density ofits very form, the statement forged at Chalcedon is truly more 'symbol' than <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>credo</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Throughout the history of the Church, the Symbol of Chalcedon has "neverhad a wide liturgical or catechetical use because of the complexity of languageand intricacy of definition."</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7'href="index.html#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[7]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This "complexity of language" moves the Symbol of Chalcedon <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outside</i> the orality of language and intoa realm of form that seeks to judge subsequent language forms and uses, butdoes not itself participate in, the common life of language in its fullestcapacity.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="index.html#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"title="">[8]</a>

<P></LI><LI>Figuring a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetics of Jesus</i> has continued to challenge subsequent generationsin both direct and indirect means, with the search to find a poetics that <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opens</i> rather <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>closes off</i> questions of meaning and engagement, allowing for thepossibility of the nexus of the sacred and the subject. Such a poetics isexplicitly open to and disclosive of the unconditioned import of meaning foundin Jesus. Finding such a poetics that <i>flows</i>in the act of writing as continuous discovery and engagement with ultimateconcern, rather than a poetics that <i>delimits</i>and ultimately <i>constricts</i> theultimate concerns of the sacred and the subject behind static renderings ofdialectical logocentrism was particularly active in the work of writers inGermany and England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the writingof those concerned with philosophy and biblical criticism in the eighteenthcentury, the role of <i>history </i>in thediscussions regarding the figuring of Jesus of Nazareth became central tochristology– attempting to create a figuring of Jesus who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i> rather than the Christ who <i>is</i>.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As stated by Gregory Dawes in<istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> The Historical Jesus Quest:</i>

<blockquote>The question of the historical Jesus is such a familiar one todaythat it is difficult for us to realise how recent a question it is.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For more than 1600 years the idea of askingsuch a question never arose. Moreprecisely, in the minds of the Christian interpreters of the Bible there was nodifference between the Jesus of history and the Jesus of the Church'sproclamation. Insofar as the Christianscriptures spoke of the incarnation of God at a particular point in humanaffairs, the accuracy of their reports was taken for granted.</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="index.html#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></blockquote>

<P></LI><LI>The challenge to traditional understandingsof the person of Jesus during this period is exemplified in the pioneering workof the late seventeenth century philosopher and ethicist Benedict deSpinoza. In his "Of the Interpretationof Scripture" from Chapter Seven of <i>Tractatustheologico-politicus</i>, Spinoza argues that the biblical interpreter is interestedin discovering only 'the meaning' of the biblical texts and not their 'truth':

<blockquote>But for this task [of interpreting scripture] we need a method andorder similar to that which we employ in interpreting Nature from the factspresented before us… we must first seek from our study of Scripture that whichis most universal and forms the basis and foundation of all Scripture; inshort, that which is commended in Scripture by all the prophets as doctrineeternal and most profitable for all mankind…Scripture does not teach formally,and as eternal doctrine. On thecontrary, we have clearly shown that the prophets themselves were not inagreement on these matters, and therefore on topics of this kind we should makeno assertion that claims to be the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, even though thenatural light of reason may be quite decisive on that point. … with regard tothe meaning of revelation, <i>it should beobserved that this method only teaches us how to discover what the prophetsreally saw or heard, and not what they intended to signify or represent by thesymbols in question. The latter we canonly guess at, not infer with certainty from the basis of Scripture</i>.</span><spanlang=EN-GB> </span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href="index.html#_ftn10"name="_ftnref10">[10]</span></a> (emphasis added)</blockquote>

<P></LI><LI>One can hearstrains of the eighteenth century writer Hermann Samuel Reimarus in Spinoza'sconclusions. In his <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fragments</i> written in 1777 and firstpublished posthumously by Lessing as fragments of unknown origin found in theDuke of Brunswick's library at Wolfenbüttel (<i>Fragments of the Wolfenbüttel Unknown</i>), Reimarus argues forscripture itself as a thoroughly <i>rewritten</i>genre – constantly revised and reshaped through the years - thereby overturningboth a historical grounding in an 'original' text and at the same timesupporting, albeit by inference, a view of scripture as a re-imaginedspace. With regard to Jesus' parables, Reimarus writes:

<blockquote>But since these secrets [the secrets of the Kingdom of God disclosedin Matthew 13:11; Mark 4:11; Luke 8:10] consist merely of an explanation offigurative concepts and the explanation, insofar as it is stripped of parable,in turn contains nothing more than the common knowledge of the promised Kingdomof God under the Messiah, one must confess that no really new orincomprehensible precepts are to be found among these secrets.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Takenote from this, to what extent people let themselves be deceived by words!</i><spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Today we are accustomed to understanding bythe word 'faith' or 'gospel' the whole body of Christian doctrine that we areto believe, or all the articles of the Christian faith in their interconnection,the entire catechism and the creed, and we particularly call 'mysteries' thosedoctrines that surpass understanding and that are neither to be understood orproved by reason alone.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="index.html#_ftn11"name="_ftnref11">[11]</span></span></a></blockquote>

<P></LI><LI>The notion of Jesus as a person of historywhose (to use Spinoza's term) <i>certainty</i>as <i>the</i> Christ could not be supportedby questions put forward by biblical criticism continued in the days followingwriters such as Spinoza, Reimarus, and Kant. This left a new generation of writers in the eighteenth and nineteenthcentury suspicious of so-called idle claims regarding the historicity of Jesus,but looking at the effects that such epistemological fractures would have uponthe grounding of poetics both in theology and literature, after history, isrendered non-essential. </span></p>

<P></LI><LI>One shift in the wake of separating theJesus of history from the Jesus of the Church's proclamation lay in the notionof <i>Jesus as the great metaphysical idea</i>that became an alternative means to support Jesus as the Christ in a new fashion.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This opens the opportunity for fiction to bea possible space for the figuring of the nexus of subject and sacred.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Lessing spoke of the "ugly, broad ditch"</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn12' href="index.html#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span><span>[12]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'> that existed between the certainty ofhistory and the certainty of reason, he saw the resolution to this proverbialchasm in the advocating for a purely <i>spiritual</i>understanding of Christology.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13'href="index.html#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[13]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This move is further articulated by J.G.

Since it is 'the possible'and 'the imagined' as well as 'the factual' that can frame the potential of thesacred meeting the subject, the central issue moves beyond <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>what</i> is written and read to <i>how</i>writing and reading is done.

<P></LI><LI>As suggested in such works as <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Towards a Christian Poetics</i></span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn19' href="index.html#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span><i><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[19]</span></span></i></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'> by Michael Edwards, the rendering of apoetics that acknowledges the full ramifications of an answer to that questionposed to Peter "who do you say that I am?" remains scarce in contemporary poetics,nowhere more so than in the very arena where such a poetics should arise,namely New Testament scholarship. Intheir recent book entitled <i>The Meaning ofJesus – Two Visions</i>, New Testament Scholars N.T. Wright and Marcus Borgcome together as representatives of traditionalist and liberal scholarshiprespectively, in an attempt to dissolve the tensions that surround currentacademic debates regarding the person of Jesus of Nazareth which have become"acrimonious, with a good deal of name calling and angry polemic in both publicand private discourse".</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn20' href="index.html#_ftn20"name="_ftnref20"><span lang=EN-GBstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'>[20]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'> The ultimate aim of this 'opendiscussion' is to provide a way through such forms of discussion and hopefullyto demonstrate a means by which scholarly discussions surrounding the person ofJesus can take place. As the subtitleof the book denotes, both Wright and Borg attempt to approach the task as'visionaries' of sorts, hoping to guide a new generation toward developing a'new vision' of how one communicates the nature and person of Jesus.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What one finds at the end of this attempt ismerely a rendering anew of forms and analogies that bring about a closedchristology, one that bears little or no resemblance to the Christ they purportto acknowledge and ultimately seek to locate.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn21' href="index.html#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span><span>[21]</span></span></span></a>

<P></LI><LI>In his 1990 lecture published in <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Granta </i>entitled "Is Nothing Sacred?"Salman Rushdie discusses the irony whereby traditionally 'religious' writingseems to be anything but religious, whilst those who dwell in the space offiction seem to find openings where the possibility of the sacred is seen.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As he compares the genres of 'religion' and'literature' he notes that:
<blockquote>Between religion and literature … there is a linguistically baseddispute. But it is not a dispute ofsimple opposites. Because whereasreligion seeks to privilege one language above all others, one set of valuesabove all others, one text above all others, the novel has always been aboutthe way in which different languages, values and narratives quarrel, and aboutthe shifting relations between them, which are relations of power.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The novel does not seek to establish aprivileged language, but it insists upon the freedom to portray and analyse thestruggle between the different contestants for such privileges.</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn22' href="index.html#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><span><span>[22]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'></span></blockquote>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:'>As Rushdiecorrectly surmises, the move into the realm of the fictive that is representedby forms such as the novel is a move <i>away</i>from the privileging of "one language above all others" and an approach towarda poetics that acknowledges the hope for "the freedom to portray and analysethe struggle" inherent in such a search.</span></p>

<P></LI><LI>In order to locate such a poetics of Jesus– a poetics that is free to portray and analyse the struggle of figuring thenexus of the subject and sacred - one must place such possibility of a poeticswhere it is called into judgement before such a poetics can be figured – adisfiguring and figuring at once. Thisentry into such a poetics is ultimately a <i>coincidentiaoppositorum</i>. Thomas Altizer asserts that such a space evokes the following:</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span>a full coming together of total opposites, the opposites of totalending and total beginning, and the totally old world or aeon and a totally newaeon or world…a <i>coincidentia oppositorum </i>isat the very centre of the Christian epic, as is a calling forth and voyage intoan apocalyptic totality, and [the Christian] epic totality is an apocalyptictotality if only because it embodies such a radical and totaltransformation. Here, thistransformation is deepest in envisioning the depths of the Godhead itself,depths that are apocalyptic depths, and hence depths unveiling a new Godheadonly by bringing an old Godhead to an end.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn23' href="index.html#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><span><span>[23]</a>

<P></LI><LI>As Altizer maintains, at the centre of theChristian epic, that is, the centre of writing that brings to mind the personof Christ, one must acknowledge that the question of the person of Jesus is theultimate <i>coincidentia oppositorum,</i> adisturbing centre-point to all concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This acknowledgement is one of, as Altizer argues, "eschatologicalproclamation and parabolic enactment" that, like the true Jesus, will "reverseevery given form of God and the world".
<blockquote>To enter this parabolic enactment through the medium of literature isto take on a <i>poetics of Jesus</i> whichwill reverse every image of Jesus we have known if we are to be open to hiscontemporary and apocalyptic presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Just such a reversal has continually occurred in the Christianimagination, a reversal not only of given images of Jesus, but also, and eventhereby, a reversal of all given Christian images of God.</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn24' href="index.html#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span><span>[24]</span></span></span></a></blockquote>

This statementbears striking similarity to contemporary post-structuralist writers such asJacques Derrida, who, while resolutely determined not to be considered asa 'religious' writer, actually attemptsto form such a poetics that Altizer argues is at the very heart of the personof Jesus. Jesus, as that subject ofwriting where subjectivity is both constructed and destroyed simultaneously,bears marked resemblance to that which Derrida argues for in his essay"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" from <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Writing and Difference</i>.</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn25' href="index.html#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><span><span>[25]</span></span></span></a></p>

<P></LI><LI>In this essay, Derrida is seeking tosituate ultimate subjectivity as it is to be determined by a given subject in aplace beyond language. Seeking not todestroy the subject, his stated wish is to "…situate it.... [This ultimatelyis] a question of knowing <i>where</i> it[the subject] comes from".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn26' href="index.html#_ftn26"name="_ftnref26"><spanstyle='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>[26]</span></span></span></a><spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this way, the origin of a subject beforelanguage is "named" by it, prior to seeking definition of pre-existentterms. This point of origin is whereone draws meaning from the "history of meanings" which form ourunderstanding. This is what Derridaterms "centre". As one follows hisargument, this "centre" resembles the "centre" argued by Altizer to be that ofJesus.</span></p>

<P></LI><LI>Jean Hyppolite, author of <i>Logic and Existence</i></span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn27' href="index.html#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>, posed the question to Derridaregarding his lecture on "Structure, Sign, and Play" as to "what a <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>centre </i>might mean"<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn28' href="index.html#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[28]</span></span></span></a>.In Hyppolite's words, is "the centre the knowledge of the general rules which,after a fashion, allow us to understand the interplay of the elements? Or isthe centre certain elements which enjoy a particular privilege with theensemble?"<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn29' href="index.html#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"title=""><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[29]</span></span></span></a>.Derrida's answer was as follows: "I don't mean to say that I thought ofapproaching an idea of the centre that would be an affirmation".<astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn30' href="index.html#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[30]</span></span></span></a>The centre of which he speaks is not a certain place as we shall see, not aplace to be affirmed and locked into meaning, for this would do to the word&quot;centre&quot; what Derrida says the term centre now <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i> - making a "substitution of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>linguistic</i> centre for <i>true</i>centre" - so that "the centre receivesdifferent forms or names" and we ultimately lose that which we seek.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Derrida's definition of "centre" constitutesabstracted definitions of a communally concerned identity: "The centre, whichis by definition unique, constitutes that very thing within a structure whichwhile <i>governing</i> that structure, <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>escapes</i> structurality".<astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn31' href="index.html#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[31]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<P></LI><LI>In the fight to define, definition in itstruest sense is lost. To say, forexample, that theology has the exclusive role and location for the spiritualformation in people's lives overturns the basic claims of Christianityitself.

<blockquote>...the [Church] lives in a strange and healing paradox disclosed… throughout thescriptures: so deeply into one's existence does the unmasking radicality of theWord strike that the radical contingency and ambiguity of all culture, allcivilisation, all institutions, even nature itself [in sum, the "world"] areunmasked by the same Word which commands and enables work <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>for </i>the world, and more concretely for the neighbour.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This Christian insight into theconventionality, the arbitrariness, the radical contingency of all culture, allnature and all institutions has a reverse side: the radical ambiguity of allculture, nature, institutions – all the world – and their constant temptationto self-aggrandisement and self-delusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Yet this very same insight into the radical contingency and realambiguity of the world posits itself not only by negating all "worldly"pretensions to divinity, atemporality, eternity, but also by positing thecommand and the possibility of living in and for this contingent, ambiguous,created and divinely beloved "world".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn33'href="index.html#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><spanstyle='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>[33]</span></span></span></a></span></blockquote>

Tracygoes on to say that "rather than repeating the domesticated slogans thatpresume to capture this dialectic ("The [Church] is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in</i> the world, but not <i>of </i>it"),it seems more correct to say that the[Church] is released (the violent imageryis exact) <i>from</i> the world, <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>for </i>the world".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn34' href="index.html#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[34]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<P></LI><LI>Attempts to figure Jesus in poetics will <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always </i>have to fight the tendency tobuild walls and choose a fixed centre rather than an organic one – a poeticsthat is delimited, static and closed rather than one that provokeseschatological proclamation and parabolic enactment that, like the true Jesus,will reverse every given form of God and the world.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn35' href="index.html#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><span><span>[35]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'>As Derrida notes, we seek delimited structures such as a closed and staticpoetics through a fixed unchanging centerpoint which ultimately "neutralise[s]…[and] reduce[s]" the truth of a subject into merely "a point of presence, afixed origin".</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn36' href="index.html#_ftn36"name="_ftnref36"><span lang=EN-GBstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'>[36]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'>It is this false centre then that controls, in the sense of containing, thestructurality of the structure, reducing it. Thus the extremes are neutralisedby the centre. </span></p>

<P></LI><LI>In "Structure, Sign, and Play," Derridaemphasises that true centre is "not a fixed locus but a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>function".</i></span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn37' href="index.html#_ftn37"name="_ftnref37"><span lang=EN-GBstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'>[37]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In one sense, then, centering as function, or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>import</i> to recall Tillich's category, need not be put in one place;the function can be distributed throughout the structure. This is another wayof understanding that the centre is not the centre; the centre as import neednot be at the central place. Moreover, if the centre as import is not a place,then it is highly variable; not only can the function or import be fulfilledfrom different places, but different centres can fulfil the same function.Derrida states that "[i]f this is so, the entire history of the concept ofstructure, before the rupture of which we are speaking, must be thought of as aseries of substitutions of centre for centre".</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn38' href="index.html#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><span><span>[38]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'> In short, the functionality of what is'centre' is itself just a substitute for a previous centre; the 'function'remains the same even if the centre has moved. </span></p>

<P></LI><LI>As Derrida notes, "the history ofmetaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history of metaphors andmetonymies".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn39' href="index.html#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"title=""><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[39]</span></span></span></a>Derrida goes on to state that, "we have no language -no syntax and no lexicon-which is foreign to this history" of metaphors and metonymies.<astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn40' href="index.html#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[40]</span></span></span></a>For example, in claims such as the seeing the sign/signifier Jesus as the"historical Jesus", the "kerygmatic Jesus", the "apocalyptic Jesus", the"liberation Jesus", or what have you, we must realise that it is only being inthe form of metaphors and metonymies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Although metaphors claim to state that "this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> that", or while metonymies, as the root indicates, make possiblechanges of names ("we will now re-name this <i>to</i><i>be</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>called</i> that"), they are nothing but descriptions and ultimatelybarriers. This is central to Derrida'sproject in "Structure, Sign, and Play" in his arguing that we need to lookbeyond our need in Western metaphysics to fight for</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span>the determination of Being as <i>presence</i>in all senses of this word. It could beshown that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to thecentre have always designated an invariable presence – <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>eidos</i>, <i>arche</i>, <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>telos</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>energeia</i>, <i>ousia</i> (essence,existence, substance, subject) <i>aletheia</i>,transcendentality, consciousness, God, man, and so forth.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn41' href="index.html#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[41]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:'>This power is,on the one hand, rhetorical, yet on the other hand, substantial and real.

The face we may seek for– the authentic Jesus – is not tobe found. The face we <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i> figure "is neither the face of Godnor the figure of man: it is their resemblance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>A resemblance which, however, we must think before, or without,the assistance of the Same".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn43' href="index.html#_ftn43"name="_ftnref43"><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>[43]</span></span></span></a><spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We who seek this 'face' are in the spacebetween

"We live inand of difference," according to Derrida.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>If Derrida's assertion is true, where does import reside?

<P></LI><LI>For Derrida, given this distinction drawnbetween true identity and metaphor, it is to be concluded that identityultimately only exists in "difference" between meaning and the label placedupon it. These labels of metaphors and metonymies only have meaning in theirability to assuage and master a certain degree of anxiety, probably the anxietyof difference, which is also the anxiety of similarity.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anxiety as to what lies behind the veil ofsignifiers such as Jesus in whatever manifestation, forces institutions todouble efforts to re-interpret terms as well as look through these signs towhat is beyond. This shift, accordingto Derrida, is the point of "rupture".</span></p>

<P></LI><LI>&quot;Rupture comes about when thestructurality of the structure had to begin to be thought".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn45' href="index.html#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><span><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'><spanstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'>[45]</span></span></span></a>Once we begin to recognise that the structure of any given sign is merely astructure, and nothing else, a rupture <i>can</i>occur. Derrida claims that "perhapssomething has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could becalled an event" where "its exterior form would be that of a rupture".</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn46' href="index.html#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><span><span>[46]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Prior to this realisation, when people believe that the structure issomething <i>other</i> than a structure,they have chosen a mere metaphor instead of import, and in short, chosen formrather than meaning. </span></p>

<P></LI><LI>According to Lee Morrissey, one way offraming Derrida's attempt in "Structure, Sign, and Play" could be understood aspart of what Hal Foster in <i>Return of theReal</i> describes as "a shift in conception -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>from reality as an effect of representation to the real as a thing oftrauma,"</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn47' href="index.html#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"title=""><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'>[47]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'> that is, the 'real' is something thatis beyond critique as 'the traumatic' is beyond category and escapes languagealtogether. This 'shift in conception'is an attempt to see <i>with</i> reality,not merely form <i>a </i>reality to beseen. Similarly, for the question of a <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetics of Jesus</i> to be resolved, arupture is needed in the false ways that meaning is made and supported. Thereality that there is <i>no</i> institution,be it the church or the academy, whose task it is to preserve separate fixedcentering points needs to be affirmed. Rather, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> are part of a larger enterprise whose "centre" is shared beyonddefinition. This calls to mind ThomasAltizer's challenge to seek "a Jesus who was the first truly apocalypticprophet, the one who first enacted a total apocalyptic ending – but anapocalyptic ending that is an apocalyptic beginning, a beginning that has beenrenewed again and again by those who embody him, or those who embody his actsand words".</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn48' href="index.html#_ftn48"name="_ftnref48"><span lang=EN-GBstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'>[48]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<P></LI><LI>In an interview, Derrida stated that "whatinterests me today is not strictly called either literature or philosophy, I'mamused by the idea that my adolescent desire – let's called it that – shouldhave directed me toward something in writing which is neither the one or theother. What is it?<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Autobiography</i>is perhaps the least adequate name, because it remains for me the mostenigmatic, the most open, even today"<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn49'href="index.html#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><spanstyle='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>[49]</span></span></span></a>.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is where I suggest the centeringcharacter begins - at its most authentic point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>This point which is "the most enigmatic, the most open" is wherewriting becomes an act of self-creating and encountering that brings such openand enigmatic authenticity is characteristic of a poetics of Jesus.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Victorian writer George Eliot noted in oneof her letters that writing which is truly autobiographical shows how a writer'smind "grew, how it was determined by the joys, sorrows and other influences ofchildhood and youth – that is a precious contribution to knowledge".</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn50' href="index.html#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><span><span>[50]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In this way, the genre of the Gospels is the true fiction as that whichfigures the self and the sacred at once, whose story is unique and universal inits writing and, to cite Heidegger, strives to 'unname naming' by providing anapocalyptic beginning that has been renewed again and again by those who embodyit as an act of 'remembrance': re-membering the broken through <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poiesis</i>.</span></p>

<P></LI><LI>Ultimately, a poetics of Jesus is never <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>formed</i>, always <i>on the way,</i> but never <i>there</i>,thus beginning this dialogue is not an easy one. As Derrida himself notes in "Structure, Sign, and Play", "thereis too much, more than one can say".<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn51'href="index.html#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><spanstyle='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>[51]</span></span></span></a> It is a continuous process that must not bestatic nor fixed if we are to "recast, if not rigorously refound a discourse
<blockquote>... [O]ne has to go throughthe experience of deconstruction"<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn52' href="index.html#_ftn52"name="_ftnref52"><spanstyle='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt'>[52]</span></span></span></a>to find another way, a new way, all the time.</blockquote>
In the end, Iam proposing a rhetorical strategy whereby one actually says more than oneappears to have said. The interplayfound in the "rupture" of the signs that denote Jesus whether in the poeticspace or within the space of a kerygmatic community can lead to a new space forJesus to be 'authentic' in the full Heideggerian sense.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In many ways I am arguing for a <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetics of Jesus</i> where entering withinis not certain nor safe, a place that is "the undiscovered country" of Hamlet'smusings and a place that is closest to Derrida's sense of<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"autobiography" as writing that is mostenigmatic and most open. This is aplace that returns to forming questions of life writ large, where people gatherand <i>that</i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>gathering becomes the defining character.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>It is a place that is open always topossible destruction of the pre-conceived, yet passionate for the clearing actof being-in-the-world and being-for-the-world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>As Derrida has said, the space of literature "allows one to say everything.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To say everything is no doubt to gather, bytranslating, all figures into one another, to totalize by formalizing, but tosay everything is also to break out of prohibitions".</span><astyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn53' href="index.html#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53"><span><span>[53]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the midst of the "New Quest" for the Historical Jesus, New Testamentscholar Günther Bornkamm stated in the opening sentence of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jesus of Nazerath</i> that "[n]o one is any longer in the position towrite a life of Jesus"</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn54' href="index.html#_ftn54"name="_ftnref54"><span lang=EN-GBstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'>[54]</span></span></span></a><spanlang=EN-GB style='font-family:'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet there remains the drive as seen in many contemporary writers totell, in the words of George Eliot, "the simple story" that is always concernedto tell all stories and ultimately to tell them all through a poetics thatfinds its form in a poetic incarnation of the one whom Schweitzer felt "comesto us as one unknown…"</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn55' href="index.html#_ftn55"name="_ftnref55">[55]</span></a></li>
