<h1>The Ambiguous Gift of Desire</h1>

<p>Charles E. Winquist<br>
Syracuse University</p>

<blockquote>
  <font size="3"><p><I>The world is all that is the case.</I> -- L. Wittgenstein</p>

  <p><I>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest
  loneliness and say to you: "This life as you live and have lived it, you will have to
  live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every
  pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in
  your life will return to you." . . . Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your
  teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment
  when you would have answered him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more
  divine."</I> -- F. Nietzsche</p>

  <p><I>The statement that God is being-itself is a nonsymbolic statement.</I> -- P. Tillich</p>

<IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/I.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="I" ALIGN="left"> want to think and talk about a gift, a bent, a capacity, a leaning, and a power
within the always already <i>given </i>of consciousness<i>. </i>I want to talk about <i>desire</i>
as an ambiguous gift, as the ambiguity of the given of consciousness. The originariness of
consciousness at the beginning of what we know as thinking, at what we know as the
capacity for reflexivity, is not itself a witness to the origin of consciousness. Whatever
image of thought we will be working with will be a belated achievement of thinking. The
memory of my first thoughts and my first words have been erased, forgotten or eroded in
the consciousness that I now know.</P>

<font class=footer><li></font>The epigrams of Wittgenstein, Nietzsche and Tillich have a discordant resonance with
each other as they make sense of the experience of consciousness. The demand that I
experience in the wake of their voices is to think and speak on a plane of immanence. Yes,
the world is the case; yes, there will be nothing new in it; and, yes, nonsymbolically the
only proposition that I can say of God is that God is being-itself. Nonsymbolically,
neither God nor being-itself can be mystified to say anything other than what I experience
as the world that is the case. We do not begin with mystification. We begin with
consciousness. We begin with objective consciousness. That is, in our noncontroversial
experience, we know consciousness as consciousness takes an object. I know of no
meaningful distinction between image and object in the theater of consciousness before
consciousness folds on itself. In its primary manifestation, what we mean by the real is
what we mean by consciousness. Problematizing consciousness and problematizing the real is
a work or achievement within consciousness, although in the phenomenality of experience it
is not necessarily a highly complex work or achievement. In our very ordinary experience
consciousness manifests a capacity for an after-thinking. It can fold on itself.
Consciousness can take its past thinking as an object of its present thinking. This seems
to be an obvious capacity not unlike the capacity to choose to raise ones arm. We witness
these capacities even if we do not understand them. To whatever we bear witness in our
experience, the plane of consciousness in that witness is a plane of immanence.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The insistence that thinking even in figures of transcendence is inscribed on a plane
of immanence is not an attempt to be reductive. It is instead a simple hesitancy that
recognizes that thinking can lose itself in its capacity for complexification before it
has assessed what is given in what we might call presentment of mind. There is a presence
to mind, or consciousness, that in its presence can be simple. I can see a tree and I can
think the image of a dog. I can do all of this without an understanding of
neurophysiology, theories of representation or theories of cultural politics. There is a
certain obviousness and incorrigibility about being able to see a tree or think a dog. Not
only do these experiences insist on themselves but my thinking resists the imposition of
any theory that says that I can’t see a tree or think a dog when the phenomenality of
my experience includes a specifically perceived tree and a specifically imagined dog.
There is a certain self-authenticating credibility about the affirmation that what is
present to consciousness is present to consciousness. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>To say that I am conscious is not to say anything about the unconscious, what is not
yet conscious, any "dark precursor" to consciousness, or the ontological status
of images, concepts or words.<A HREF="#n1" NAME="f1">1</A> I am conscious of a world and I do not know what this <i>world</i>
is; and, I am conscious of being conscious and I do not know what the <i>I</i> is that is
conscious of being conscious. In the givenness of consciousness of the world I do not know
the structure of the world or the infrastructure of the consciousness knowing the world. I
am conscious and, because of what I do not know in the immediacy of the experience of
being conscious, I am problematically conscious. I am interrogatively conscious and in
this sense transcendentally conscious. That is, consciousness can interrogate the
conditions of its own possibility. Consciousness can be consciousness of such an
interrogative possibility just as it can see a tree and think a dog.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Consciousness as a given may not be valued as a gift but it does have a certain
serendipitous incorrigibility in its presentment. In the simplest manifestation of
conscious phenomenality, a thereness of mind or thereness of the world, it doesn’t
tell the tale of its genealogy. This is why we do not have confidence in first philosophy
as an independent and unique thinking about being, consciousness, or language. The
originariness of our thinking which is an always already experience is not identical with
its origin. The thinking of being <i>qua</i> being, the <i>cogito</i>, or a grammatology
are all elaborations or complexifications which if willed are willed as an after-thinking
of the given phenomenality of consciousness. If we are radically and skeptically empirical
and admit as consciousness only what is given as consciousness, empiricism begins to look
like a Berkeleyan idealism where we are only enfranchised to say that <i>esse</i> is <i>percipi</i>
and quickly slip into the <i>cul de sac </i>of Santayana’s solipsism of the present
moment.<A HREF="#n2" NAME="f2">2</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>What is evident is that thinkers of idealism or solipsism never stay with the
minimalism of their thinking by their own engaging in practices aimed at the refutation of
idealism [Kant] or in evoking God [Berkeley] or animal faith [Santayana] within the
processes of thinking. At the end of the twentieth century it is clear that if philosophy
has traversed the trajectory, suggested by Habermas, from philosophies of being to
philosophies of consciousness to philosophies of language, that the basic concepts in these
philosophies such as being, subjectivity, archewriting are<i> </i>themselves<i> aporetic</i>
formulations or are intimately intertwined with <i>aporetic</i> formulations such as God,
the transcendental imagination or <i>différance </i>that mark rifts, undecidabilities,
incompleteness or indeterminacy on any plane of immanence. Thinking can secondarily
formulate first principles which are not in themselves first principles. This recognition
is a catharsis. Ironically, radical thinking regularly deracinates itself. It makes its
own texts insecure by pushing them to the limits of their determinateness. Yes, it makes
sense for Tillich in the rigorousness of his analysis of the existential situation to say
that "[t]he statement that God is being-itself is a non-symbolic statement."<A HREF="#n3" NAME="f3">3</A> On a
plane of immanence this is saying that God is dead. On a plane of immanence the procedure
of the schematism of the pure concepts of the understanding is a displacement or loss of
the self and <i>différance</i> is the closure of the book and the beginning of writing as
an endless play of signifying. What we have witnessed and called postmodern philosophy and
theology are deconstructionist writings of the death of God as the unbearable lightness of
being <i>qua</i> being and in the wake of the death of God the experience of the
displacement of the subject or loss of the unified self.<A HREF="#n4" NAME="f4">4</A> It is possible that we are too
far removed from the explanatory power of philosophies of being to be deeply troubled by
the death of God; but, most of us are still troubled by the displacement of subjectivity
or loss of a unified self that is an ungrounding of truth and meaning. It is hard to give
up the little woman or little man of interiority making sense out of watching the theater
of the play of phenomenal images and thus to think of the theater itself as the
interiority of thinking. It is hard to think of sense or meaning as appearances
functionally rooted in contingent relationships of disparate forces. It is hard to think
of singularities clustered in multiplicities constituting empiricities in the
phenomenality of appearance that we cannot get behind because they are themselves the
conditions of what is given as consciousness. It is hard to give up an image of thinking
that simulates the reflexivity of thinking without ever being able to confirm the identity
of the image with the thinking of which it is its belated or deferred effect. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>All of these recognitions are based on evidence within thinking that its phenomenal
manifestations are subverted or transcended by its own capacities to construct figurations
of a primary process as a condition for the secondary manifestation that we know as the
first meaning of thinking. That is, consciousness subverts itself with its capacity to
think the idea of the unconscious or not yet conscious as a response to understand the
presence of anomalous parapraxes in the psychopathology of everyday life. A concept like
the unconscious is the achievement of an alogical negative fissuring of the phenomenal
display of experience. There can also be a transcendence of consciousness that fissures
its phenomenal display by its capacity to complexify its phenomenal display into
configurations of meaning that are not commensurate with its own logic. Whitehead’s
causal efficacy is a necessary condition for presentational immediacy but it is never
contained within its explanatory presence. Deleuze’s "dark precursor" for a
logic of sense is already a part of reality that is a condition for understanding and not
its result. Although, paradoxically, the concept is a result of the thinking that we call
understanding.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The given of consciousness is not only the simple given of the phenomenality of present
images. This given includes also a given capacity, gift, or bent to complexify itself in
configurations of extremity, reflexivities, folds, tropes and nonconcepts. That we <i>can</i>
think theologically, cosmologically or metaphysically is ascertained by the <i>fact </i>of
thinking theologically, cosmologically or metaphysically. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>This gift, capacity or bent is an exigency of thinking that in its extreme expression
is theological. We are capable of thinking the notion of "that than which nothing
greater can be thought." When this capacity is experienced as a need we can name it
desire. Desire is an ambiguous gift. The capacity to formulate and think a <i>term</i> of
the ontological argument secures an affirmation of the existence of such a capacity to
think. It marks or remarks a desire for ultimacy. It is a formal achievement of thinking.
It does not secure a content for thinking. There is a distinction between the formal and
material infrastructure of thinking. Thinking the concept of "that than which nothing
greater can be thought" does not provide an image. It is, as Tillich understood, a
non-symbolic concept. To have an ultimate concern says much about what it means to be
consciously human. But, it does not in-itself provide an object or tell us about the
object of the ultimate concern. Desire is an ambiguous gift because it is an unfinished
reality. Desire cannot guarantee its satisfaction.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Desire is an ambiguous gift of the givenness of consciousness because, although it is
an elaboration of this given, it is itself hard to think. Desire is a gift within the
given that is unlike the clarity and distinctness of the phenomenality of experience that
is presentationally immediate. Desire hints that the image of thought that resolves itself
into identities and has dominated so much of the western philosophical tradition is not
adequate. The image is prephilosophical and has always troubled philosophy by being able
to be troubled by philosophy. The image is probably generated alongside a faithful habit
or habit of faith rather than being the result of the analysis of the phenomenality of
experience. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>In the dialectic of fictional exfoliations of Nietzschean philosophy, Milan Kundera
names this habit of faith <i>a categorical agreement with being</i>.<A HREF="#n5" name="f5">5</A><P></li>

<blockquote>
  Behind all the European faiths, religious and political, we find the first chapter of
  Genesis, which tells us that the world was created properly, that human existence is good,
  and that we are therefore entitled to multiply. Let us call this basic faith a <i>categorical
  agreement with being</i>.
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>He calls the aesthetic ideal of this agreement <i>kitsch</i>. "[K]itsch excludes
everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence."<A HREF="#n6" name="f6">6</A> It
excludes from its paradise any excitement, bodily stains or excrement, and desire.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The problem with an image of <i>a categorical agreement with being</i> is that it
requires a philosophy of identity to realize itself and identity is analytically troubled
by the need for third form [Plato], phantasms [The Aristotelean tradition] or a
transcendental imagination [Kant]. It always seems to be the third that is a hybrid and
not pure. It appears that whenever we rigorously think about thinking that identities are
surface effects of differences. Identity is among simulacra. What drops out of sight is
the generation of the image, the thickness of the body and the dark precursor of sense or
the complex realm of formal possibility embedded in the materiality of the world that is
the case.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>To think only about identities is to be bound to a surface simplicity. In this clean
well-lighted place thinking is too easily trivialized. There is neither depth nor an
equivalent surface complexity. We lose meaning philosophically and affect psychologically.
This thinking is not enough. It is <i>kitsch </i>because it is a moral abstraction<i>.</i>
It is a moral abstraction that is challenged by the aesthetic capacity for thinking to
reflexively complexify itself. It is a moral abstraction that denies its genealogy. It is
a forgetfulness that forgets its forgetfulness.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>As we have been taught by Deleuze, Nietzsche’s introduction of sense and value
into philosophical thinking would make us suspicious of any epistemology that is dependent
upon a moral abstraction no matter how good it makes us feel. The gift of desire that
comes with the givenness of consciousness is the felt capacity to ingress into the
thinking process the experience of whatever we call the thirdness of form so that the
process repeats life but always with a difference. Anything less than a thinking about
thinking that can express its own creativity is a thinking that will be disappointing.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>In the experience of its productive secondariness, thinking needs to be able to value
the creativity of its productive imagination. To be responsive to its own desire, thinking
needs to be able to value those products which can function heuristically and often
relativistically in its further complexification and satisfaction. In <i>Difference and
Repetition,</i> Deleuze writes that "[t]he thought which is born in thought, the act
of thinking which is neither given by innateness nor presupposed by reminiscence but
engendered in its genitality, is a thought without image."<A HREF="#n7" name="f7">7</A> Those who read Deleuze
know that in this quote it is a particular image that Deleuze is rejecting, an image of
thinking sameness, an image of<i> a categorical agreement with being</i>. It is the
becoming of thinking, the making of arrangements or rhizomorphic like assemblages that
better expresses thought born in the always already of thinking.<A HREF="#n8" name="f8">8</A> We need different
concepts to think thinking in its genitality or desire.<A HREF="#n9" name="f9">9</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>All of this emphasis on thinking out of thinking can mislead us back to Descartes’
<i>cogito.</i> I think that this would be a mistake because it is possible to caricature
Descartes and read his <i>Meditations</i> as a reinscription of the image of thinking as <i>a</i>
<i>categorical agreement with being</i>. The <i>Meditations</i> can be read as a creation
story. Descartes’ radical doubt is a method of exclusion and forgetfulness. We can
forget all of the mess of existence that is not clear and distinctly certain. The self is
created as a pure subjectivity and that which is other is brought back through the
capacity of a pure subjectivity to think a reality that is more than itself. Under the
aegis of a constructed pure subjectivity Descartes can be about the naming of the other.
Descartes can name God, the animals or the world. Here, the <i>categorical agreement with
being</i> is an agreement with the being or <i>I am</i> of the <i>cogito. </i>Locke
complicated the discussion with the <i>aporetic</i> notion of the idea but kept the <i>cogito</i>
pure with the notion of the <i>tabula rasa</i>. Berkeley understood that it never made
sense to think of the mind as a <i>tabula rasa</i>. The thickness of experience was always
too complex of an affair that when reduced to its simplest expression is the relatedness
of <i>esse</i> is <i>percipi</i> and not a blank slate that has itself never been
experienced. Thinking has a capacity to fold its exteriority into an interiority through
formulations of extremity that are the complexifications of reflexivity as a secondary
process. There is no subjectivity that can be separated from objectivity in a radical
skeptical empiricism. There are only arrangements or associations. When arrangements
contract through repetitions we have a habit and that habit is as Hume suggests what we
mean by subjectivity when we are unable to establish subjectivity in a causal nexus. Hume
is, as Boundas suggests in his reading of Deleuze’s study of Hume, a philosopher of
the imagination.<A HREF="#n10" name="f10">10</A> Hume is the mediating imaginative link between Berkeley’s
unconstrained empirical idealism and Kant’s strict transcendental idealism.
Kant’s unity of apperception is a Humean habit. This claim is a viable construction
when we read backward from Deleuze into Hume and forward from Hume to Kant.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The most important implication of Hume’s denial that there is any simple sense
impression of a necessary connexion is that it is at the same time a denial of privilege
to any "certain way" of thinking that excludes other ways of thinking. Hume
invokes taste and sentiment in philosophy and reintroduces desire in giving assent to any
particular arguments or arrangements in thinking. "I do nothing but decide from my
feeling concerning the superiority of their influence."<A HREF="#n11" name="f11">11</A> Thinking is the becoming of
habits that have consequences. Thinking that has intensity or force and vivacity is
self-authenticating. Criteria for assent in thinking fall back on thinking itself.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>This in no way means that thinking is simply willful. The originariness of thinking is
experienced as fully contingent and not as fully relative. I am always already thinking.
My capacity to complicate that thinking is a given capacity within what is already given.
A taste for Plato or Kant or Derrida does not privilege these philosophers on their own
terms. It instead imports a systematicity, functional or dysfunctional, into an already
existing processional nexus. To newly read or think a philosopher’s work is to
augment the heterogeneity of the consciousness that is already at work. It is not unlike
the importing of new sensations by traveling to new places. The materiality of thinking in
spoken or written language imposes on the sensory experience of consciousness as does the
materiality of a Gothic cathedral. It doesn’t make sense to say that a cathedral is
true and that an airport is untrue or that a horse is true and a cow is untrue. We
distinguish these experiences based on their differences and intensities and our tastes..
We also do this in our thinking about thinking. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Desire seeks intensity in thinking as its satisfaction. Its ambiguity as a gift is that
without satisfaction it is a restlessness; and, moves or strategies in thinking to
increase intensity can disrupt a secure habit of subjectivity. Arrangements are subject to
disordering. Desire is a vectored gift. It moves thinking into difference and not
sameness. There is no repetition without difference. There is no movement of sameness. The
gift of desire is the language of a trope for acknowledging that the given of
consciousness is givenness of a movement. There is no sameness in the phenomenality of
conscious experience. Sameness is a construction from familiarity and similarity read back
onto the forgetfulness of past conscious experiences. We may desire the security of
constructions of sameness in movements of consciousness because of the shadowing sense of
a possible disordering; but, this desire conflicts with the self-authenticating desire for
intensity. Ironically, the security of sameness can diminish the consciousness that it is
trying to secure. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The problem with trying to justify or privilege any particular constructions of
consciousness is that, as given, there is no inside or outside of consciousness to which
consciousness can appeal. Consciousness as a recurrent vectored phenomena can activate new
vectors by folding and complexifying itself but then what is still given is consciousness.<A HREF="#n12" name="f12">12</A>
We don't seem to be able to say anything other than that consciousness is feeling and
its measure is its own force and vivacity. Psychologically we experience a diminishment of
consciousness when we think and speak without affect and aesthetically we experience a
diminishment of consciousness in the blurring of contrast. On all levels, philosophically,
psychologically or neurophysiologically, consciousness is manifest or given in a hybrid
construction of heterogenous realities or forces. There is always some configuration of a
contrast between a figure and a ground or a contrast between two actualities or between
actualities and possibilities. These distinctions are primarily variations on coarse and
fine grained descriptive analyses of what we know as the phenomenality of consciousness.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The question we face in whatever is the moment of our thinking is not whether we accept
the privileged given of consciousness and desire as a gift of possible complexification
within that given. We have no choice. The question is what we do with consciousness and
its manifest possibilities as given. Can we say <i>yes</i> to what is the case? <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>I think we can only say <i>yes</i> if we realize that desire is bound to the experience
of difference. Of course, we can secondarily know and talk about desire as a tropological
figuration in the language of difference. And, since the only languages we know are
languages of difference, desire can only be reinforced and intensified in its expression.
The question of <i>yes </i>or <i>no</i> to the gift of desire is practically a question of
whether we in the linguistic elaboration or folding of consciousness will enfranchise or
banish the language of desire.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>I am not talking about words. Words by themselves can pornographically isolate desire
from its entailments and risks. Desire is an affair of complexity. It is the freedom of
consciousness to augment itself by cathecting its primary process of coming to
representation by attending to the heterogenous world of its contextuality, by importing
and entertaining the systematicity of order in language and the systematicity of thinking
other than itself and by the capacity of consciousness to fold reflexively on itself in
the generation of a new order. The question is whether we will strategically and
tactically implement desire in what we call and know as thinking. That is, are we willing
to say <i>yes</i> to desire by experimentally developing strategies and tactics within our
discursive and thinking practices to constantly intertwine the given of actuality with the
given of possibility? <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>If we say <i>yes</i>, there are no safe texts. There is no identity to which we can
return. The eternal recurrence of the same is the repetition of difference. The courage to
say <i>yes </i>resides in the desiring knowledge that we can never exhaust what it means
to say <i>yes</i>. In that moment of thinking courage, maybe we understand Nietzsche when
he says to his demon: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more
divine."<A HREF="#n13" name="f13">13</A><P></li>
