<h1>God and Derrida's Politics: At the Edge of Exemplarity</h1>

<p><i>O my friends--is there a friend?</i></p>
<HR size=1>
<ol start=2>
<P><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/T.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="T" ALIGN="LEFT">his essay seeks to explicate Derrida's emphasis on the importance of exemplarity as a
feature of philosophical thought, primarily through an understanding of <i>The Politics of Friendship</i>. Exemplarity, on Derrida's view, has been central to the
philosophical conception of friendship from Aristotle onward. The metaphysical
understanding of examples as supplementary to our thought has led to a determinate
politics of friendship, a politics that regulates friendship and excludes both God and
women from being friends with man. By deconstructing this understanding of exemplarity,
Derrida opens the possibility of a different thought of examples, and thereby a different
politics. As figured in the possibility of friendship with God or women through the
modality of testimony or confession, deconstruction opens this thought of politics at the
precise point at which the thought of politics, friendship and responsibility has been
restricted by philosophy.</P>

<font class=footer><li></font>Let us begin with examples of friendship. While considering the relationship between
friendship and self-love, in book nine of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> Aristotle
undertakes a sort of phenomenological reduction by inquiring as to the substance of
friendship. In response to the question, "What is friendship?" Aristotle lists
five constitutive qualities: wishing good for the friend's own sake, wishing the friend to
exist, living with another, having the same taste, and grieving and rejoicing together.
Yet while seemingly in search of the pure concept of friendship, Aristotle does not simply
list qualities of friendship; he gives examples as well. A friend is "one who wishes
his friend to exist and live, for his sake; which <i>mothers</i> do to their children, and
friends do who have come into conflict."<A HREF="#n1" name="f1">1</A> The first friend encountered in this chapter
is a mother. Likewise, mothers exemplify another quality of friendship: a friend is
"one who grieves and rejoices with his friend; and this too is found in mothers most
of all." Only these two qualities are associated with the example of the mother.
Coincidence? I think not. Both qualities mentioned involve the <i>activity </i>of
friendship--loving rather than being-loved. In <i>Politics of Friendship</i>, Derrida
addresses the disproportionate asymmetry between loving and being-loved found here at the
heart of Greek friendship. Without the asymmetry exemplified in a mother's love for her
children, friendship between equals could not get started; without the initial activity of
loving, the potential for friendship could not be reduced to act. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Yet the mother--this first example of a friend--is not a friend. The mother is excluded
from friendship because she loves without being loved in return. She is <i>already</i> a
friend--in her asymmetrical love of the other--and <i>not-yet</i> a friend, since her love
is not reciprocated. The temporality of her friendship cannot appear within the
phenomenological field. Friendship does not appear presently or <i>as such</i> until the
self or subject arrives on the scene: "Now each of these (the qualities of
friendship) is true of the good man's relation to himself." In having all five
qualities of friendship, self-love is treated as the exemplary form of friendship, but it
comes onto the scene only after the mother. Let us study this movement closely: the mother
is called up as a figure of absolute friendship, loving without being loved in a purely
asymmetrical relation. She is then suppressed and removed from friendship proper, replaced
by the exemplary presence-to-self of self-love. The reduction of friendship to self-love
is brought about through a conjuration of the mother--calling her up so as to suppress
her. The essence of friendship appears, it would seem, through the "hauntology"
discussed by Derrida in <i>Specters of Marx</i>, both calling and suppressing the pure
loving of a mother in this act of conjuration.<A HREF="#n2" name="f2">2</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Self-love exemplifies friendship proper in its presence-to-self, since one loves
oneself and is thereby loved simultaneously. One is strictly equal (i.e., identical) to
oneself, and one's love is immediately reciprocated; self-love is thus the best example of
friendship. By establishing self-love as the pinnacle of reciprocity and equality,
philosophy has inscribed friendship within its self-present temporality even as the mother
haunts this whole discussion. This best example of friendship, however, is not friendship
as a concept, or in the universal sense, since it is still a particular case. In fact,
self-love--the best example of friendship--<i>is not</i> friendship since there is no
friend here at all. In self-love, the best example of friendship, there is no friend. The
best example of friendship as such already contains within itself its own ruin. Self-love
is really only an example of friendship if one is virtuous and open to another. As
Aristotle notes, only by such openness to the other in justice and virtue can one
differentiate self-love in the positive sense from the worst egoism.<A HREF="#n3" name="f3">3</A> The best friendship
must double itself to be friendship. Thus, an alternative thought of friendship arises
from within Aristotle's account of friendship. Friendship, <i>to be friendship</i>, must
be with more than one. My friends, as Derrida seeks to show, there is never a single
friend.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Here we can see what Derrida means by the <i>exemplarity</i> of friendship and how
canonical friendship demonstrates the exemplary logic of metaphysics and ontology.<A HREF="#n4" name="f4">4</A> The
best example becomes exemplary by excluding other examples--which allows it to forget that
it is just an example, one among others. The best example manifests the general rule. The
features that constitute the universal concept of friendship are visible in the example of
self-love. The concept, however, cannot appear <i>as such</i> without moving beyond the
example, negating its concreteness and freeing itself from the singularity of this case.
Friendship cannot be friendship without reducing the example in which it first comes to
consciousness. On the one hand, there is no essence of friendship without a reduction or
negation of the friend. On the other hand, without the example the concept would be
unknowable; only in the friend (or self-love) is friendship conceivable. The exemplary
reduction of friendship is not an absolute negation of the particular, but rather a
determinate negation that conserves the example even in surpassing it.<A HREF="#n5" name="f5">5</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Examples, then, serve a supplementary function in the self-presentation of universal
concepts, exhibiting a concreteness that must be called up and then suppressed. For
Derrida, however, this supplementary function is irreducible; making the thought of the
universal possible, concrete examples likewise make its presence impossible. Undecidably
between the singular and universal, exemplarity defers metaphysics and makes its presence
impossible, even while giving rise to its thought. This rethinking of examples indicates
the depth of Bataille's influence on Derrida. By deferring the concepts they represent,
examples open onto a general rather than a restricted economy. Precisely where examples
would seem to be useful in demonstrating universals, they <i>refuse</i> to be useful in
this manner, since their play denies the appearance to consciousness of universals as
such. The exemplarity of thought that metaphysics so often seeks to retain for its own
purposes is in fact without purpose. When one recognizes that the best example is still an
example, one case among many, rather than suppressing them exemplarity allows one to
substitute other examples for the best: any other can be wholly other. Representative of
what Bataille would call the nonutilitarian aspect of our subjectivity, examples open a
play of meaning in which humanity, art, and responsibility can be called forth.<A HREF="#n6" name="f6">6</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>If canonical friendship consists of present reciprocity and equality such that
friendship is at home with itself, then it is no surprise that its figure is that of the
brother. Fraternity, in establishing equality and shared origin between two or more,
allows one to think of a friend as <i>another </i>self. As brothers share the same origin,
they are equal to one another, and can have contemporaneous reciprocity. In the Greek
system, friendship is fraternity, not only in Aristotle, where friendship and fraternity
are linked to democracy, but throughout canonical discourses on friendship--Cicero,
Montaigne, and Carl Schmitt as well. Now, "fraternity" is not always limited to
biological brotherhood: this term has played an essential part in the extension of
friendship and democracy, as is manifest in the French Revolution's slogan "liberty,
equality, and fraternity." There is a sense in which the effort to think beyond
concrete political distinctions towards a universal friendship of humanity--in terms of
the extension of civil rights or the transcendence of ethnocentrism and
nationalism--depends rhetorically upon fraternity even while surpassing biological,
national, or other empirical formulations of brotherhood. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Through his reading of Carl Schmitt's <i>The Concept of the Political, </i>Derrida
questions and displaces friendship's connection with fraternity throughout <i>Politics of
Friendship</i>. For Schmitt, humanity's essence as political animal is actualized through
the opposition of friends and enemies. Whom one loves or values is defined in opposition
to whom one will kill, and humanity would disappear if this opposition broke down. Schmitt
sees the state as the preeminent vehicle of politics, but this status is only guaranteed
by a rigid distinction between civil war and war in the proper sense. As Derrida notes,
Schmitt can only make this distinction through reference to fraternity: one can hate or be
at civil war with those within one's family or state, but those whom one hates (<i>hostis</i>)
in such disputes are not the enemy (<i>inimicus</i>). The enemy proper is outside the
state. This distinction must be "effective" or "actual" and therefore
present; such presence, as the limit of politics, can only be ensured so long as
fraternity guards the border or maintains the opposition between civil war and war between
states.<A HREF="#n7" name="f7">7</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The most "effective" politics treats fraternity as natural or factual rather
than simply symbolic. While the rhetoric of fraternity is useful as a critique, only once
actual, biological fraternity or shared origin is established do canonical friendship and
politics become possible. Derrida writes: "This kinship nurtures a constant and
homophilial friendship not only in words but in fact, in deeds. In other words, the
effectivity/actuality of the tie of friendship, that which assures constancy beyond
discourses, is indeed real kinship, the reality of the tie of birth."<A HREF="#n8" name="f8">8</A> Legal equality
is most effective when based upon natural equality. By determining fraternity as a
natural, essential property that one can discover equality and friendship in a scientific
manner and maintain a rigorous friend/enemy distinction as the essence of politics.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Fraternity, then, would seem to figure the limit of friendship <i>and</i> the limit of
politics. By exposing the symbolic process underlying fraternity's appearance as a natural
phenomenon, Derrida calls this limit into question. On Derrida's view, natural fraternity
is only thinkable <i>via</i> the legal and rhetorical equality of politics;
"natural," original fraternity appears through such inscription and repetition
of fraternity. Derrida writes:<P></li>

<blockquote>
  What we are calling here 'fraternization', is what produces
  symbolically, conventionally, through authorized engagement, a <i>determined politics</i>,
  which, be it left- or right-wing, alleges a real fraternity or regulates spiritual
  fraternity, fraternity in the figurative sense, <i>on the symbolic projection of a real or
  natural fraternity</i>.<A HREF="#n9" name="f9">9</A>
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>The equality of biology only appears as real within the repetition and differing of the
symbolic from itself. Fraternity only appears to be natural fraternity because it always
already exceeds itself; friendship and enmity are opposed by Schmitt because both
friendship and enmity are already determined as fraternal. Biological fraternity is called
up as a memory to legitimate the political order and give it a necessity its symbolic
process cannot give itself. Natural brotherhood becomes the limit of the history of
friendship, equality, and fraternity; it is a "necessary fiction," constituting
the order in its apparent necessity and forgetting its fictive beginnings. To treat
friendship as natural rather than symbolic forgets the possibility of questioning the
political order founded on the opposition between friend and enemy. Within this
opposition, friendship is always in danger of being inverted into enmity and hatred. To
live in memory of natural brotherhood forgets the friendship figured by the mother, a
friendship undetermined by fraternity that may hold the possibility of a politics beyond
the friend/enemy opposition. Could there be friendship without fraternity, love and
friendship beyond war and enemies? <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>In this discussion of friendship and politics in the proper sense, the sister and the
feminine is nowhere to be found. This does not mean that women are excluded from
friendship and the political. Rather, what Derrida sees at work is a <i>neutralization</i>
of sexual difference in canonical politics, fraternity or friendship. Sexual difference
remains unthought within this horizon. To return briefly to Aristotle, insofar as a woman
has her own virtue she can be a true friend of her husband, but to that extent she is
virile and not specifically female (PF, 158). A woman cannot appear <i>as such</i> within
fraternal politics or friendship; sexual difference, then, must be kept outside the
borders of fraternity. As we have already seen in passing from the mother to self-love,
the determination of friendship as present through the privilege of the example of
self-love suppresses the temporality of the mother's friendship. To remember the mother's
friendship displaces fraternity and questions its limitation of friendship. By
deconstructing fraternity, a more radical friendship can perhaps be thought.<A HREF="#n10" name="f10">10</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>To this end, Derrida retranslates the oft-quoted phrase of Aristotle: rather than,
"O my friends, there is no friend," Derrida translates it as follows: "He
who has too many friends has no friend." While the first translation seems to address
friends given its apostrophic form, Derrida's constative translation is in fact a more
open form of address. This constative sentence still rests upon a trust or performative
oath, and this performative pledge founds a radically open address. One <i>may</i> be
speaking to someone as a friend who is not a brother. Insofar as the address remains
undetermined, it represents the thought of a singular address across sexual difference or
beyond the limits of fraternity. This messianic address exists in the mode of the
"perhaps" (<i>peut-être</i>). In this mode, it can be neither certain nor a
fact. For Derrida, this irreducibility of the perhaps to presence, of what can-be to what
is, keeps open the messianic possibility of a real future, a future-to-come not fixed by
the present. He writes: "This (perhaps) is a moment when the disjunction between
thinking and knowing becomes crucial...This does not amount to conceding a hypothetical or
conditional dimension but to marking a difference between 'there is' and 'is' or
exists'--that is to say, the words of presence."<A HREF="#n11" name="f11">11</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>This possibility presented by the perhaps, which remains open, to-come and futural, is
at the heart of Derrida's politics. In the address of the perhaps, a more radical and
absolute democracy can be thought in which all are equal and not just brothers. Derrida's
politics can be summarized as a politics of attention. I use attention for its double
sense: on the one hand, listening, consciousness, and concentration focused on that in
front of oneself; but also waiting, anticipation, and openness beyond that which one
faces. This real future can be conceived only by attending to the one in front of you as
wholly other, while recognizing that <i>all</i> others are wholly other and attending or
waiting for the other other to come. Responsibility and singularity are thus found in the
repetition and differing from itself of alterity; friendship is always friendship with
more than one. In seeking to treat others as others and to treat all others equally,
deconstruction--so often conceived as nihilistic, apolitical, or even antidemocratic--may
instead call democracy beyond the limited and oppositional democracy of the liberal state,
fraternity, and parties. Deconstruction, the thought of every other as wholly other, is
the thought of a radical democracy.<A HREF="#n12" name="f12">12</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>It may be difficult to imagine what a "radical democracy" would mean, but
perhaps it could best be approached in the form of a question. Consider the following
question. Can we, in our culture, distinguish between liberal democracy and what one could
term, in an admittedly provocative manner, Multinational Socialism? What to make of
certain features of fascism that not only appear within, but also seem to be protected by,
the organization of nation-states promoting the spread of liberal democracy? Are liberal
states and the United Nations able to protect the rights and interests of their citizens
in the face of corporate activity that transcends national borders and leads to an
ever-increasing concentration of wealth? Are we able to distinguish between "economic
health" and shareholder earnings--or is the secret of liberal democracy plutocracy?
What of a system that through trade agreements plays labor in one country off against
itself in another, increasing shareholder wealth and corporate growth while restraining
the earnings of the workers precisely <i>through</i> the differences in wages between
"first" and "third" world workers? All of these questions may simply
appear to be <i>posed</i>, as a substitute for real political action, and admittedly, they
do not suffice as political action themselves. However, without such questions, without
dislocating the limits of political discourse, the political process can easily turn into
a mindless programme in which responsibility and singularity can no longer be found.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The messianic character of Derrida's emphasis on the "perhaps" brings us to
the question of the theological import of such a nonfraternal friendship. Classically, for
example in Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas, one cannot be friends with God so long as one
is human.<A HREF="#n13" name="f13">13</A> For Aristotle, this is one of the crucial aporias regarding friendship; by
wishing a friend to be a god, one would be wishing the friend no longer to be a human
friend. Friendship with God is thus related to human friendship in two ways. First, the
thought of God is <i>internal</i> to the economy of fraternal friendship. As the limit or
exterior of fraternal friendship, God must be kept outside for human friendship to be
possible. The idea of God would thereby ground with greater certainty the fraternal
friendship of the present. Yet even as friendship with God seems to secure the fraternal,
is it not likewise a thought of friendship that exceeds reciprocity, without economic
exchange or presence, precisely because God is so distant from oneself? Insofar as one
thinks of friendship with God, God might call friendship beyond itself, maintaining the
idea of an impossible community even within the restricted present of fraternal
friendship. Could not a friendship with God "share the solitude of the event,"<A HREF="#n14" name="f14">14</A>
in Blanchot's words, rupturing the symmetry of friendship from within?<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Perhaps. This possibility, however, would only seem to arise when one <i>names</i> God.
Insofar as God's name is not God, to name God contains at least two gestures at once.
First, to name God is to predicate, speak of and thematize God. As Derrida has noted many
times, this thematization and violence occurs even in the most apophatic moments of
negative theology. On the other hand, if there is this difference between God and the
name, then to give to the name may disrupt thematic, restricted, and fraternal friendship.
By giving to the name, that which God gives to us does not return to God; the name thus
opens the (impossible) possibility of a gift without return. By naming, one gives to God
the absolute singularity of giving without return; one lets God be safe beyond
thematization. Such a singular address is only possible if God and the name are different.
This difference cannot present itself within discourse; God without the name is only
thinkable in prayer, testimony, and the mode of the "perhaps."<A HREF="#n15" name="f15">15</A><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>For Derrida, Augustine's <i>Confessions</i> exemplify this testimonial modality of
discourse.<A HREF="#n16" name="f16">16</A> Without reference to "doing" the truth, a doing that exceeds knowing
in its enactment, Augustine's confession makes no sense. As discussed in <i>Sauf le nom</i>,
confession and testimony to God are inseparable from an act of charity towards other
humans. Augustine writes the <i>Confessions</i> so that they are to other Christians even
as they are addressed to God; charity addresses itself to any other. Love, as ecstatic,
calls us out of ourselves to friendship in drawing us towards the beloved, but also calls
us beyond that relationship as well. This movement nonetheless remains restricted within
theological discourse. The <i>Confessions</i> are written to other Christians as Christian
<i>brothers; </i>charity is determined as <i>fraternal</i> love. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>On the one hand, then, God's name displaces the limitations of fraternal friendship in
the performative address of confession; yet, on the other hand, it reinscribes fraternity
as the limit of human friendship. This friendship to which friendship with God testifies
would only be possible in light of the impossibility of its presence. God's name opens the
thought of this possibility, but also guards against its actuality; messianic friendship
is only thought <i>as</i> possibility or "perhaps." Because such an act of
naming holds the possibility of further community, one can read Derrida as affirming its
discourse. Not for the limited friendship of Christian fraternity, but rather for the way
it may testify to the messianic, futural possibility of friendship. This testimony is only
possible through a deconstruction of fraternal friendship that opens the thought of an
address <i>to </i>another, undetermined by the thematic, restricted friendship of
which one speaks.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Where metaphysics tries to get beyond examples to a pure concept of friendship,
Derrida's thought of friendship affirms the exemplarity of our discourse and turns it in a
new direction. Precisely insofar as our thought depends on examples, so that the universal
concept never appears as such in its purity, exemplarity may testify to the future as an
open event irreducible to cognition. This different thought of examples opens a thought of
singular responsibility exceeding the order of knowledge. The general economy of our
subjectivity, in which the appearance as such of universals is lost, permits the thought
of a friendship, responsibility or decision irreducible to any program, technique or
knowledge of the subject. In this an-archical responsibility, we encounter Derrida's deep
affinity with the work of Emmanuel Levinas. Insofar as exemplarity resists the pure
presence of conceptuality, the thought of a subjectivity beyond being, cognition and the
ego becomes possible. It is within the deconstruction of metaphysics, its undoing by its
dependence upon examples, that Derrida sees the Levinasian emphasis on responsibility,
singularity, and alterity as possible. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>It is important to note that the possibility of testimony as a relation irreducible to
knowledge arises at the border of religion. Politics and responsibility, for Derrida,
consist precisely in the opening of the same to the other through the deconstruction of
the limit--law, nature, or fraternity. More exactly, it is the deconstruction of the limit
as an unimpeachable given. Through this deconstruction, which demands that one recognize
that the limit is undecidably both <i>within</i> cognition and <i>beyond</i> cognition,
the undecidability of the limit can present itself to us. This undecidability is starkly
illuminated in <i>Politics of Friendship</i>, in which fraternity opens both the
possibility of friendship and the possibility of hostility. Because deconstruction gives
rise to this undecidability, in which the responsibility of real decision is found,
Derrida finds it to be ultimately affirmative and to hold the messianic possibility of a
goodness of humanity.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Derrida's deconstruction of exemplarity thus opens the thought of the future and of an
alternative politics. The messianic, radically heterogeneous to any concrete order, opens
a space in which politics can occur. By not calling for a specific act, it opens the space
of decision and responsibility and thereby gives politics a chance. Thus, the thought of a
messianic, futural friendship or a friendship to come is not the thought of an
eschatological event unavailable to us here and now, but rather a condition for decision,
event, and singularity, and thereby for the experience of responsibility and love today.
The other before you is wholly other, and this other needs your attention, but also attend
to the fact that there are other others; remember that the one before you is an example.
This double responsibility gives rise to the thought of a radical singularity and
democracy. For this thought, Derrida is deeply indebted to Bataille; by ruining the
self-certain and restricted meaning of concepts from the outset, examples open a play of
meaning and a possibility of humanity that transcends economic formulation. Yet by reading
Bataille politically, Derrida places his work in the service of a Levinasian concern for
alterity. <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Within this different thought of exemplarity, a different thought of theology arises as
well. If friendship with more than one is the condition for the possibility of any
politics, and this testimonial structure is exemplified in friendship with God, theology
might open the very possibility of friendship beyond fraternity even as it defers it. Much
as self-love may be justice to the other or pure egoism, friendship with God may open the
possibility of messianic friendship even as it can neutralize differences. Theology may
lead to "globalatinization" or to the neutralization of sexual difference, but
in its own internal possibility of testimony, it may have contested its own totalizing
gesture and opened itself to the other.<A HREF="#n17" name="f17">17</A> While risking the collapse of the event and
decision into the structures of ontology and metaphysics, theology likewise maintains the
thought of the event as testimony, confession, and prayer. In this possibility, which can
only be thought rather than known, it may hold out the possibility of a messianic,
singular friendship and the politics of a love without enmity.<P></li>

    of fraternity, Aristotle's passage regarding self-love (which shares the same logic) seems
    pertinent to me for the purposes of this essay insofar as it brings together a) the
    determination of friendship as present, and b) the accompanying neutralization of sexual
    difference and reduction of alterity to an alter ego. <A HREF="#f5" name="n5">Back</A></li>

    Without Reserve," in <i>Writing and Difference</i>, trans. Bass (Chicago: U. Chicago
    Press, 1978). Also, George Bataille, <i>Theory of Religion</i>, trans. Hurley (New York:

  <li>Generally, this can be related to Derrida's remarks on sexual and
    ontological difference. See "<i>Geschlecht: difference sexuelle, difference
    ontologique</i>," in <i>Psyché: Inventions de l'autre</i> (Galilée, 1987), 395-414. <A HREF="#f10" name="n10">Back</A></li>

  <li>Ibid., p. 38: "Shall we say that this responsibility which inspires
    (in Nietzsche) a discourse of hostility towards 'democratic taste' and 'modern ideas' is
    exercised against democracy in general, modernity in general; or that, <i>on the contrary</i>,
    it responds in the name of a hyperbole of democracy or modernity to come before it, prior
    to its coming--a hyperbole for which the 'taste' and 'ideas' would be, in this Europe and
    this America there named by Nietzsche, but the mediocre caricatures, the talkative good
    conscience, the perversion and the prejudice--the 'misuse of the term' <i>democracy</i>?" <A HREF="#f12" name="n12">Back</A></li>
  <li>Aristotle, <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> viii.7 (Ross translation, p.
    204).For Thomas, I am referring to our inability to be equal to God solely on the basis of
    human nature; charity is friendship with God precisely insofar as it elevates us. <A HREF="#f13" name="n13">Back</A></li>

  <li>Such prayer and testimony, while thinkable as separate from praise (what
    Derrida calls the "encomium" in "How Not to Speak: Denials") always
    appears conjoined with praise, dissimulating itself in the predicative form of theological
    discourse. Prayer, in order to be prayer, cannot be reduced to praise. John Caputo's
    reading of "How Not to Speak," which basically equates the two, misses the
    secretive relation between prayer and praise that Derrida seeks to capture there. This is
    not a minor point, since it seems to me to lead to his view of "religion without
    religion" as attempting to abstract itself from theological discourse and tradition,
    when it seems to me to make more sense to read deconstruction as an <i>internal </i>contestation
    of theology. See Derrida, "How Not to Speak: Denials," in <i>Derrida and
    Negative Theology , </i>ed. Coward and Foshay (Albany: SUNY Press, 1992), pp. 99, 110-112;
    John Caputo, <i>The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida: Religion Without Religion</i>

    Time I. Counterfeit Money</i>, trans. Kamuf (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992)
    p. 169. Often overlooked in discussions of the gift is the fact that the gift--if there is
    any--is an event of friendship. <A HREF="#f16" name="n16">Back</A></li>
  <li>Two recent works deserve far more consideration than I can give them
    here. First, Derrida's recent piece on religion and its criticism of the spread of
    religion as a "globalatinization" demonstrates the danger Derrida sees in
    religion. See "Faith and Knowledge: The Two Sources of Religion Within the Limits of
    Reason Alone," in <i>Religion</i>, ed. Derrida and Vattimo (Stanford: Stanford
    University Press, 1998) pp. 1-78. Second, his work in memory of Levinas points to another
    possibility, particularly with regard to the undecidability of paternity and fecundity.
    Levinas's writing on this topic may be the worst androcentrism or the thought of sexual
    difference beyond ontological determination. Derrida leaves this question suspended
    without a response. See "<i>Le mot d'accueil</i>," in <i>Adieu à Emmanuel
    Levinas</i> (Paris: Galilée, 1997), especially pp. 49-84. <A HREF="#f17" name="n17">Back</A></li>
