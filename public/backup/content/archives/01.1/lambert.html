<h2>Kant and Extra-Terrestrials</h2>
<ol start=2>
<p><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/I.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="I" ALIGN="left">n 1755, nearly thirty years before <i>The Critique of Pure Reason,</i> Immanuel Kant
published a little known treatise on Newtonian mechanics and cosmology called <i>Universal
Natural History and Theory of the Heavens.</i> [<a name="n1" href="#f1">1</a>] It
represents one of those oddities one runs into now and then, like finding an old
photograph of oneself in the embarrassing tuxedo before a senior prom. It portrays the
immature mind of the philosopher and demonstrates the tenor and range of any number of
academic philosophers of Kant’s time all engaged in heady explorations of the
universe guided by the principles first charted by Newton. (The subtitle reads <i>"An
Essay on the Constitution and Mechanical Origin of the Entire Cosmic-Edifice treated
according to Newtonian Principles."</i>) Odder still is the appendix of the third
part, "Of the Inhabitants of the Planets" (pp. 183ff) where, as the title
promises, Kant takes up a philosophical discussion of extra-terrestrials. Of course, no
"Theory of the Heavens" worth it weight in star-dust would leave out a section
that speculates on the physical probability of other life forms than the human species,
and here we already see the inclination toward what the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze
would later call Kant’s "Copernican turn." [<a name="n2" href="#f2">2</a>]
However, Kant’s exposition is not so subtle and scientific concerning the existence
of extra-terrestrials. Their existence, for Kant, is proven by mathematical certainty, and
his discussion would have a closer resemblance today to those Web pages that contain ample
information and data concerning the different species of extra-terrestrial beings, along
with de-classified photos of the pyramids on Mars and instructions on how to build your
own tele-porter or flying saucer. "At any rate," Kant declares, "most
planets are certainly inhabited, and those that are not, will be one day" (Kant 186).
</p>

<font class=footer><li></font>In the introductory part of his exposition, Kant confronts the "sheer
madness" of those that deny this fact with a charge of hubris that is illustrated
with an anecdote taken from a certain "witty writer from The Hague" [<a
name="n3" href="#f3">3</a>]: "’Those creatures,’ says he,<p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>which live in the forests on the head of a beggar, had long since considered their
  location an immense ball, and themselves as the masterpiece of creation, when one of them,
  endowed by Heaven with a more refined spirit, a small Fontenelle of his species,
  unexpectedly became familiar with the head of a nobleman. Immediately he called together
  all the witty heads of his quarters and told them with excitement: ‘We are not the
  only living beings in nature; see, there, that new land, more lice live there’"
  (Kant 185)</p>
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>By analogy, Kant refutes Man’s comparative certainty concerning his own state of
perfection in the universe. <p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because, according to its belief, nature is infinitely well adapted to its existence,
  the insect holds as irrelevant the entire remainder of nature which does not imply a
  direct reference to its species as the center of her aims. Man, standing immensely removed
  from the uppermost ranks of beings, is indeed bold to flatter himself in a similar
  delusion about the necessity of his own existence. (Kant 185) </p>
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>Given Kant’s certainty concerning the ontological question of extra-terrestrials,
the only question for him to speculate about is the organization of their
perception-consciousness system, since their "manner of operating and feeling is
bound to the condition of the material with which they are connected and also depends on
the intensity of impressions which the world evokes in them according to the properties of
the relation of their habitat to the center of attraction and heat [i.e., the sun]"
(Kant 184). In other words, Kant’s primary concern is mechanical and concerns how the
mind and body are linked or coordinated in extra-terrestrial life-forms; how perception,
feeling, and representation (sensation<i>) </i>are variously "co-ordinated"
within different environments. Kant’s early focus in this text already foregrounds
the primary thesis that will appear in <i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i> concerning the
distinction between the matter and the form of sensibility, and the divisions between the
external senses (which are conditioned by objects in space), and the
"subjective" (or inner senses) senses which are determined by their existence in
time, by the "affect" of affection (<i>Gemüt) </i>itself. Thus, according to
the later critical thesis, which we can already see a primitive sketch of here,
sensibility defined as the "character of receptivity" is dependent for its
"quality" (its <i>quale,</i> which can be defined as its<i> </i>intensity or
reality) on the way in which the subject is capable of being modified by the object in
general<i>. </i>Consequently, in the speculations concerning the corporeality of
extra-terrestrials, we have a vivid illustration concerning how the differential
characteristics of the "object in general" (the manifold, or the a priori
intuitions of space and time) would at the same time create different
"co-ordinations" of the faculties that are dependent on the former for their
subjective and objective unity. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>"In short," Kant writes, "the body is indispensable for thinking"
(Kant 186). Consequently, since the discussion of extra-terrestrials is itself part of a
larger "theory of the heavens" according to Newtonian principles, the question
of gravity will play a paramount role in determining the "matter of sensibility"
which, in turn, will determine the quality of perception-consciousness that belongs to
different worlds. At this point of his exposition, Kant adapts the ancient traditions of
the theory of angels and spiritology to a Newtonian cosmology; the planets further from
the sun where gravity and heat are less a factor are likely to produce the condition for a
finer sensibility and for sublime thought among the inhabitants. Thus, Jupiter and Venus
are perhaps at an adequate distance to support a degree of perfection that is impossible
on Earth or Mars. Aside from the surprise of this theory, it is significant to note that
it provides a scientific rationale for what I referred to above as Kant’s
"Copernican turn." There is even a certain prejudice detectable in Kant’s
preference for the colder planets, which could echo his preference for his own native
Königsberg; however, the major significance here is the reversal of heliocentrism that
has been dominant in the philosophical tradition since the pre-Socratics, at least
certainly, since Plato first linked the system of ideas to an invisible sun that
represents a higher universe that governs the universe of appearances.<p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Given this virulent "anti-heliocentrism" which is present in Kant’s
description of the relation between the planets and the degree of perfection that is
obtainable for each one, how do things fair with man? Not too well, I’m afraid.
"He would even become the most despicable at least in the eyes of true wisdom, if the
hope for future life did not elevate him, and if a period of complete development were not
in store for the faculties enclosed in him" (Kant 187). Thus,<p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]f one wants to look for impediments, which keep human nature in such deep abasement,
  it will be found in the crudeness of matter into which his spiritual part is sunk, in the
  unbending of the fibers, and in the sluggishness and immobility of the fluids which should
  obey its stirrings. The nerves and brain deliver to him only gross and unclear
  concepts, and because he cannot counterbalance in the interior of his thinking ability the
  impact of sensory impressions with sufficiently powerful ideas, he will be carried away by
  his passions, confused and overwhelmed by the turmoil of the elements that maintain his
  bodily machine. (Kant 187)</p>
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>By contrast, the inhabitants of Jupiter are composed of much lighter and more volatile
matter, "so that the weak excitation which the sun can produce at that distance may
move those bodily machines as powerfully as it performs this function in the lower regions
closer to the sun" (Kant 189). This leads Kant to his first major conclusion
concerning the difference that the location in space (i.e., the distance from the sun) has
on the "matter of sensibility" of extra-terrestrials:<p></li>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>That the excellence of thinking natures, the promptness of their reflections, the
  clarity and vivacity of the notions that come to them through external impression,
  together with their ability to put them together, finally also in the skill of their
  actual use, in short, the whole range of their perfection, stands under a certain rule,
  according to which these natures become more excellent and perfect in proportion to the
  distance of their habitats from the sun. </i>(Kant 189—<i>emphasis in original</i>)<i>
  </i></p>
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>The second major comparison that Kant makes concerns time, "the form of
interiority for the subject" which is conditioned by the quicker rotation of the
planets on their axes, and consequently, the briefer alternation between day and night.
"We know that the need for time is something relative [ . . .] Therefore, the same
time, which for one creature is just a moment, may very well be for another a very long
duration in which a long sequence of changes unfolds through a fast chain of
efficiency" (Kant 191). <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>But what conclusions can we draw from this, in some ways, very 18<sup>th</sup> century
piece of science fiction? On the one hand, Kant seems to hold out for the possibility that
as human nature moves further from the sun, by some form of migration that he would later
describe as Nature’s design in the essay "On Perpetual Peace," the matter
of sensibility will undergo modification and a greater degree of perfection. Is Kant
suggesting that this is the future that lies in store for the "full development of
our faculties"? That one day, we will become the inhabitants of Jupiter and Venus,
and enjoy a greater agility in body and mind? Perhaps. And yet, in the present, according
to the current conditions that bind each inhabitant to the matter that corresponds to its
habitat, there is no possibility of occupying the same moment, since the "inhabitants
of the earth and Venus cannot exchange their habitats without mutual destruction"
(Kant 188). Consequently, although the teleology of a Divine or cosmic plan of the
colonization of the planets is interesting, it comes to an impasse precisely around
perhaps Kant’s greatest insight which is already foregrounded in this early
speculation: the a priori relationship (even inter-dependence) of matter and sensibility.
And yet, following the trajectory that Kant himself takes to resolve a similar impasse
that appears after the first two critiques, there is a space "in-between" where
the human and the extra-terrestrial can, even if only provisionally, encounter one
another. The space of aesthetics, and in particular, of the art-work. That is, as Kant
discovered later in the third critique, <i>The Critique of Judgment</i>, it is through the
aesthetic medium alone that we might have the possibility of escaping the confinement that
determines the current arrangement of our faculties; thus, art is more <i>receptive </i>to
different arrangements as well as to the possibility of another "form of
sensibility" which, using the above comparison already established by Kant, could be
likened to the "subjective" perspective of an extra-terrestrial. <p></li>
</ol>
<h2>The Extra-Terrestrial in Modern Art</h2>
<ol start=10>
<font class=footer><li></font>Following Kant’s example, let us simply concede to the existence of
extra-terrestrials. Accepting this fact, a question would eventually concern us: what is
an extra-terrestrial art? This amounts to the same question Kant first raised concerning
the organization of the faculties in different material universes. In attempting a
description, I will have to be rather threadbare in sketching its possible axioms or its
principles of composition (material, aesthetic, political, etc.), since I cannot refer to
any manifesto, any monograph, any existing group, or colony. It is not "a
movement" in the strictest sense. Consequently, the conception of such an art must
remain a kind of <i>presentiment</i>, without demonstration <i>here and now</i>, in part,
due to the current limitations of sensibility among terrestrials, the so-called
"human beings." The limit of the sensible conditions which may today prevent the
reception of an extra-terrestrial art can be represented by factors that are temporal,
material, or cultural, and even bio-physical and organic (i.e., the limits imposed on human
reception by the organic coordination of the "senses," what Kant called the <i>sentiendum</i>).
These are the three principle causes of the insensible which roughly approximate the
conditions or limitations imposed by time (past, future and otherwise), place (culture and
experience), and form (human or in-human).<p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Taking up the first limitation, time is a strictly human perspective and we are
creatures stuck to our own proximity, the present, which extends like a small islet into
the whole of time. By way of an analogy, the Goldfish swimming next to me at this moment
has a conscious duration of 8 seconds, so by the time he circumnavigates his small
aquarium, he arrives to the same point in space, although temporally all traces of his
previous circuit just 8 seconds before have been vanquished and he arrives to perceive a
new bouquet of plastic kelp, and a new underwater cottage with the red door and the
turning windmill. When I first learned this I realized that my Goldfish could be swimming
in Lake Michigan and he wouldn’t perceive the difference, and I imagine that the
duration of the human being is structurally identical—it is simply a question of a
different volume. Therefore, what is not perceived<i> here and now</i>, in the present, is
conceived of as being <i>then and there</i>, in a future present or, indirectly, in a past
present; neither of which can extend beyond the human dimension. However, in order to
signal the perspective of the extra-terrestrial, we might have to concede that what is
undemonstrable <i>here and now </i>may neither belong to another time sunken deep in
memory (in the past) nor still to come (the future), but rather to the conditions of an
experience whose roots are planted in the soil of another world, virtual and yet still
incompossible with our own. This dimension might refer us a present that is
"Other," which cannot be defined in terms of the present we inhabit, but rather
in terms of the cultural and material conditions that belong to another
"life-world" (<i>Lebenswelt</i>), to employ Husserl’s term, which forbid
its inclusion in another world without the necessary occasion of violence. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Let us extend our discussion of the first limitation a bit further, since time itself will
constitute the principle obstacle to our conception of art from an extra-terrestrial
perspective. This is true particularly because of the economic and material determinations
of time (i.e. the time of wages, of capital) upon the work of art, which transforms this<i>
work</i> into a cultural value, or an ornament of class and wealth. On the one hand, these
determinations have been responsible for producing a kind of vertigo of bad consciousness
in the artist. Hence, the gesture of <i>painting a canvas</i> itself has been opened to
scrutiny by those who assert that it has a very culturally and class determined
significance. The very gesture of the painter is already a sign of culture and presupposes
a leisurely duration, and therefore, expressing the possibilities of a certain social
class and economic property, and limiting the formal range of perception, restricts the
composition and combination of materials, and restraints the body (the body must be
stationary and up-right, the hand closed around the brush like a tool). Thus, the modern
painter belongs to a certain constellation of forces which determine the <i>work</i> of
art in its material analogy to economic activity--even though art functions at this stage
as its shadowy and unreal double. The work of art opposes the product of commerce with the
infinity of an <i>oeuvre, </i>and the definite worth of labor with the eternal
fluctuations of fame and obscurity of the artist’s personality. Art, at this
stage--and painting, in particular--redeems a vulgar determination of time by offering
a metaphor of labor in the pathos of the artist’s relation to a long and indefinite
time of "work"; in the suffering of artist, the public finds an infinite (and
potentially "invaluable") source of satisfaction, which is not without its hint
of cruelty. The artist bends over the work of art, and the public finds this kind of work
inscrutable and selfishly motivated ("…and you call that work?");
therefore, the pain of anonymity and non-recognition that more often than not grip the
artist and causes him or her to suffer appears as a strange form of justice from the
public’s perception. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>On the other hand, the gesture of "painting a canvas" in the modern period
has given way to "tearing or ripping," "pasting,"
"spraying," which are activities that belong to a different theory of perception
which can only take place in a violence performed upon the perceived, or "the
consciousness of the given." Again, let me emphasize that the sensibility that the
art-work embodies presupposes a certain violence; the perception of the art-work cannot
exist alongside the common and quotidian perceptions that constitute the everyday; rather
it enters into battle with the latter in order to destroy and to "work-over"
(similar to the function of the dream-work) the stock and clichéd sensibility. In the
modern period, the "work" of art (and of the artist, in particular) no longer
finds a resemblance with the duration of economic activity, but rather with the
characteristic operations performed by dream work, where the visible undergoes a series of
<i>distortions</i> in order to bear the perceived to the level of consciousness. In other
words, all perception must be "cut-up," "ripped open," "destroyed
and then re-constructed." The difference between this determination of the art-work
and the earlier one is that the material of perception is no longer offered a
"natural" or independent perspective that the artist simply amplifies and
resonates with in order to transform it into a style of a personality or genius. Rather, the material of perception is already an
interpretation of a dominant perspective that organizes and directs the senses and
assembles the range of materials for expression (a dominant perspective, moreover, which
uses the aesthetic categories of the "beautiful," "the pleasant,"
"the harmonious," as a means an ideological end). The formal procedures
available to the artist at this stage are as infinite as materials themselves; each
material component has a certain range of formal properties (density, color, texture,
pliability, etc.) that determines its possibilities for expression. For example, paper has
certain possibilities that are absent in plaster, but present in cloth; ink expresses
certain attributes (the line, for instance), which metamorphoses in pastel or watercolors,
and even more in collage, mixed media, or metal. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>By means of this proliferation of new materials and their corresponding techniques,
certain artists and works of modern art seek to liberate themselves from this economic
determination of time toward which they bear an understandable allergic reaction. Thus, the work of art 
is not held to the limits of what is <i>here and now</i>. Rather, it creates; it busies
itself with what the German painter Paul Klee called the<i> Zwischennwelt</i>, a
"world between." Art occupies this intermediate zone--where it intercepts and
mediates, even translates experience between heteronomous conditions, communities, even
times of reception and entire worlds. This heteronomity with which art is said to occupy itself--in order to draw from it its materials, its textures, its color, its figures--bears
the conditions of an object in which we recognize something new. Of course, "<i>We
Moderns</i>" understand this: <i>Art does not imitate!</i> This has even become the
categorical imperative—i.e., <i>"make it new!"</i>—of much of what we
call modern art, which forms the generic trait of classification in the taxonomy of new
forms. From here on, art does not take what is merely demonstrable for its limit, but
constantly seeks a presentiment of other conditions and new materials, and finer
sensibilities of reception in its spectators or "public"; even though this has
led to a more and more "privatized public" composed of the artists themselves,
as well as other art professionals or specialists (the critic, the curator, the dealer,
the corporate consumer). <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>And yet, because this strikes us as nothing new, the form of "new" itself has
recently been relegated to the status of a cliché--to a timelessness where art becomes
undone between times, to a place that echoes out of bounds with any effective form of
novelty, and to a formlessness where the art-work dissipates into a rarefied and cerebral
atmosphere of self-consumption. This has led to the melancholy of much of modern art. (As
a result, the shadow of its novelty, or "modernity," falls across the blank and
expressionless gaze of the spectator who, like Eurydice, grows tired of the same old song
and heads for the door of the underworld, vowing to spend an eternity in hell, rather than attend
another opening at the MOCA.) [<a name="n4" href="#f4">4</a>] Is it that the event of something new
has become stale? Or rather, is it that what French philosopher Gilles
Deleuze called our <i>sentiendum</i>,
our feeling for the new itself is a category of a tradition that is already in the process
of evolving and growing old? Therefore, what we have called a feeling of <i>presentiment</i>
can only take place when it is subtracted from the aesthetic and aesthetic-political
programs that have sought to represent it (e.g. Surrealism, Dadaism, Cubism, etc.). These
programs have only discerned its form early and placed their signature upon it in the
manner of Duchamp. And it may now be the place to question whether the "new"
also bears the signature of a culture that seeks to establish and authorize it as a
distinct "spiritual property" that expresses the <i>genie</i> of a nation or a
race. (After all, it is not simply by chance that the so-called primitive painters at
Lascaux were also primitive Europeans and, first and foremost, primitive French.) <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>What was just outlined corresponds to our second limitation, that of place. It is
because the cultural and economic forces that condition human perception belong to this
limitation that time, from this perspective, shapes and establishes our perception of the
new itself; a perspective which provides a fundamental obstacle to our <i>presentiment</i>
of the event or ad-vent of the extra-terrestrial in modern art. Therefore, an art that
seeks to "represent the new" is not yet the art of presentiment; its is not an
extra-terrestrial art. It is for this reason that the artist of presentiment must always
seek to invent--simultaneously, so to speak--both the conditions of the object that he or
she presents as well as the community of its reception. (This may occur without regard to
whether his or her subjects, or the materials or techniques he or she may employ, are
recognized by the representatives of a reigning definition of culture.) It is in this
sense that the art-work might appeal to or evoke another nature in the community it
addresses--a nature that might appear to human sentiment as something monstrous or
in-human--a community that may or may not yet exist in this world, or whose existence may
only be discerned in the traces of what remains in the passing of another. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Why this art might appear monstrous can be addressed under the third limitation, the
organic relationship of the art-work to the current arrangement and coordination of the
senses. According to this aspect, the art-work often appeals to what lies beyond a normal
human sensibility, to another "form of sentience." This is why the modern
art-work often appears as excessive, producing in the consciousness of the spectator an
affect which can be likened to a drug which causes a new organic coordination of the
visible. This final limitation re-valorizes a certain organic determination of the work of
art, although in a non-romantic or transcendental sense. In other words, it reattaches the
notion of the organ, or the <i>ergon</i>, to the <i>work </i>of art. The image that
appears on the canvas, or the form that is made up of plaster and metal, functions as an
external and added sense-organ that supplements and expands the rather finite inventory of
human sensibility. The impressions caused by the work in the body of the spectator become
part of the artist’s materials, by which the art-work itself heightens and increases
the inventory of the body’s possible affects. Only in this way can the art-work
itself discover what the body can do by the invention of new and finer perceptions,
different and variable emotions, and ways of perceiving and thinking that have been yet
unknown, un-thought or imperceptible. The spectator before the painting might respond:
"What is this feeling, this emotion, this thought that is racing in my veins and
which threatens to overcome me, or is filling me with an uncontrollable desire to look
away?" Of course, not all responses need be violent. They seem to be dependent upon
individual predisposition, or upon the severity of the constraints upon expression by the
culture in which the spectator’s encounter with the work of art unfolds. Given the
right conditions, however, some responses may take the form of an inexplicable calm and
serenity, or the perception--perhaps hallucination--of an object that the spectator cannot
name, a color or texture that has never been seen before on earth. These impressions
(visual, tactile, ideational or symbolic) can only be accounted for by the addition and
amplification of a new organic coordination of the human senses that the work of art
itself embodies. Hence, the canvas stretches to form a second skin on the body of the
spectator; at the same time, it unfolds impressions upon a surface which belongs neither
to the object of the spectator’s perception nor to the spectator himself or herself,
but rather to a surface of perception that maps the human nervous system onto the duration
that unfolds before the spectator’s gaze. Only in this manner, can the artist
simultaneously discover the material of perception as well as the conditions of reception
sensibility by stimulating a new coordination of the visible, the palpable, the
perceptible and the thinkable. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>As an aside, probably no artist has understood this better than Paul Klee, who
developed a theory of colors based upon the physical effects of how colors mix in the eye
of a spectator. Consequently, he abandoned any linear conception of color (represented by
the natural phenomenon of a rainbow) and, along with it, any pathetic conception derived
from the domain of the human, the higher animal, with its tragic struggles between the
body and the soul. In place of this, he constructed a series of six colors, grouping them
in three couples, or opposing diameters, running back and forth from red to green, from
yellow to violet, and from blue to orange; all three diameters fixed at a point (the
center of the chromatic circle) which expresses what he named <i>le pointe gris</i>. Klee
proved his theory of color by conducting an experiment in which he observed that the
effect left upon the retina by the sudden withdrawal of red after a long exposure was not
red, but green (hence the couple red-green will constitute one of the three diameters);
thus proving that there are two complementary colors alternatively engendered in the eye,
and between them, the point gray where they are equally mixed. Gray is not a color, then,
but the expression of the principle of homeostasis, and represents the balance movement and
counter-movement along each diameter. "The reciprocity or alternation of the scale
red-green returns us to the pendulum between movement and counter-movement. It also
recalls the mobile balance which will finally immobilize itself at the intersection of the
gray. This in no way signifies that red and green are captured in a static representation,
with all the red on one side and all the green on the other. Such a representation would
not suggest the simultaneous alternation, since it would be necessary to pass by leaping
from one term to the other by a principle of construction." [<a name="n5" href="#f5">5</a>]<p></li>

<h2>The Artist in the Caves of L.A.: Jorgé Sicre and the Extra-Terrestrial </h2>
<ol start=19>
<font class=footer><li></font>This last aspect bears an important reflection upon the possible ethical and religious
significance of the figure of extra-terrestrial in modern art, and it is from this angle
of reflection that I'd like to approach the example of the extra-terrestrial in the
painting of the Cuban-American artist, Jorgé Sicre. Sicre's painting explicitly takes up the
themes and figures of the extra-terrestrial and combines them with indigenous and cultural
legends from Native-American and Mezo-American traditions in particular, and this has the
effect of creating a hybrid of both primitive and modern expressions of eschatological
desire. This hybridity will be discussed in terms of its ethical implications; therefore,
in asking the question, "What or who is the extra-terrestrial?," in our response we cannot be
certain, except that it is both the subject of Sicre’s art as well as the community
to which this art is addressed.<p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>"The most amazing thing that has come down to us from the pre-historic human is
presentiment," Chicaro said, "and it will always continue." However, in
Sicre’s painting, the <i>pre- </i>of sentiment no longer shares the same root in the
unconscious as that of pre-history. At least, it is not the pre-history represented by the
"archetype" which is reduced to a sentimental communion with the primitive
emotions--that is, to feeling which operates by mythic analogy along the ancient but
familiar contours of human emotional perception. If the archetype is retained by Sicre in
his painting, then it is only as a figure for researching a more unnatural nuptial of memory,
which destroys the relation of mythic forms to the habit (<i>habitus</i>) of the human
form. Again, this aspect of seeking the "inhuman" (Lyotard) recalls one of the
themes of the late Nineteenth century, the "non-reproductive" function of the
art object. In other words, before this aspect of the modern work of art, a Culture would
no longer find "a second life," so to speak, in the art-work which redeems it
and offers it absolution for its quotidian violence; the art-work itself no longer seeks
to present the reflection of a culture, a nation or a state, a race, a dominant ethnicity,
or even gender. The art-work’s resistance to immediate consumption by a dominant
culture which signals a "non-reproductive" spirit is one of Sicre’s most
recurrent themes. It is often figured by the encounter between Oedipus and the sphinx;
however, for Sicre, the sphinx and her question are situated in relation to the recent
discovery of a pyramidal system on the surface of Mars, beneath a red and breathless sky
that is no longer the same atmosphere that supported Oedipus when his answer defeated the
sphinx. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The face that silently stares back at us from the surface of Mars is not the face of
Oedipus, and the sphinx will not be so easily vanquished with a cunning response, since
this time, she never poses a question to Oedipus, but rather seems a bit bored by his
presence. It by the presentiment of such an encounter that Sicre might question whether
the painters of Lascaux belong, in fact, to the narrative of our evolution. Of course,
Sicre is not alone in this feeling. Burroughs knew very well about
extra-terrestrials, and often wrote about them; Bacon painted their portraits.<p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>For Sicre, this face to face encounter situates the question of "the human"
in a different, non-anthropological, dimension; one that shares the same continuum as a
kind of secrecy which cuts across several discontinuous presents--species, sexes,
groups--only a few of which the human can occupy and still remain within the margins of its
former habitat. Presentiment, then, is a moment which is found to be anterior to every
apparatus of communication, a moment that is incommensurable, but present all the same. If
it takes the form of a secret, this is only due to an inadequate organization of the human
<i>sensorium</i> in the present, to the constraints of a notion of community which excludes
what is alien and which figures secrecy and monstrosity together as the two hidden faces
of the unknown and the imperceptible. Yet, there are some that share a secret yet to be
invented, outside of and irreducible to the conspiratorial art of governments, of secret
agencies, of the state. It is a secret which is necessarily too large for them, since it
cannot be filed. If there is any destination for the political, and for the
extra-terrestrial, in contemporary art, here it is represented by the presentiment of a
secret and alien sentience--a shape of feeling, a way of thought, formed by another form
of intelligence--opposed to the traditional forms of human rationality. Here, we have
breached the response to the question--"who or what is the extra-terrestrial?"
The extra-terrestrial is, literally, <i>extra</i>-terrestrial: one who has no space, no
time within the world; who approaches from the outside invoking wonder or disgust, at
times even horror. For such a being, there is no memory of the earth, no genealogical
filiation with habitus, no ethos, or ego-system supported by its hereditary branches and
genetic flows. Perhaps this forms a problematic resemblance, even alliance, between the
extra-terrestrial and the terrestrial alien, which may account for the hybridity in
Sicre’s art. One could probably say that the first extra-terrestrial registered in
the census of European consciousness was the figure of the post-Diaspora Jew. In America,
the alien would trace an essential relation with the cultural memory of the Native
American. Thus, the pre-historic relation to the alien is figured, at one level, as that
of the ghost: an earlier <i>ethos</i> of a people, a nation, or race that was over-written
by the arrival of another group whose sedentary consciousness and notion of property
reversed the priority of habitation. But there is a difference between the ghost and the
phantoms of <i>ethos</i>, and the figure of the alien who approaches from outside the
possibility of memory or race, in another rhythm than the one that runs between species
and genus. Popular culture still tries to interpret the alien (the future) in terms of its
own ghosts (its past), as the community assembled from the dark and secret lives of its
victims. In response to these forms of cultural abjection, Sicre traces, within the
continuum that is marked in popular culture by the secret visitations of U.F.O.s, another
encounter of an alien still un-mapped in contemporary geo-politics. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>"Visitation," however, is not an event which arrives, which happens, to a
people or to a sedentary subject; neither does it arrive to any apparatus of property and
identity which could accept it--which could "welcome the alien"--without
undergoing a fundamental metamorphosis, a loss of previous identity, and a positive
molting of sexual and ethnic attributes, speech, habit and habitat. Perhaps this is why
such encounters have been reported as only happening in places where the forms and
techniques of community are vacant or have not yet occurred, thereby linking the site of
aboriginal and primitive to the hyper-futural, or to cyber-space. These places are often
represented in film by the under-developed rural sites of the civilization, in deserts, or
on vast and unpopulated stretches of the ocean; any place that is not yet inscribed and
organized by the systems of culture and the State, or where material flux is in excess of
the forms that discipline it. The extra-terrestrial seems to be drawn precisely to these
points as to a medium which could accommodate its nature. Thus, the visitation often
happens far outside the city, deep in the caves, in places where there will be few
witnesses, or nobody outside the person who is immediately caught up in the encounter--who
is, in turn, immediately alienated from the community to which he or she formerly
belonged. From that point on, he or she must decide whether to live out his or her life in the
solitude of this experience, telling no one, or join those who would accept this--and who
would, in turn, "welcome the alien." Such a being is on the border between his
or her own "experience" and the impossibility of its communication, since its
immediate communication already presupposes the derisory status of its representation by a
larger culture who cannot receive it without doing violence to its form (an experience for
which German feminists in the 70’s adopted the word <i>Sprachlösigkeit</i>,
speechlessness). <p></li>

<P></center>

<font class=footer><li></font>At the center of Sicre's depiction of the figure of the extra-terrestrial is what
philosopher Emmanuel Levinas describes as the "face to face" encounter between
the human being and that which is beyond or otherwise than human (<i>Autrui</i>), which
bears the implict allusion to the figure of theophany. The "face to face"
encounter multiplies and populates all of Sicre’s paintings like an <i>idée fixée, </i>or
like a weed, or a virus. Each encounter (or "visitation") represents a virtual
presence of a conversation without idiom, a mutual regard without eyes or ears, or a kind
of intercourse between the human and in-human that unfolds and swells in the telepathic
nature of a strange and discontinuous collective experience. These encounters are the
lapidary signs of a community who barely exists on this earth. It is a sign exchanged
between those have become alienated, whose former affiliations have been dissolved as a
result of their "abduction" by an encounter which has carried them away from their
former kind and caused them to enter into the movement of "becoming-alien,"
either alone or collectively with others. And yet, it must be emphasized that the term
alienation is a movement toward the exceptional, the extra-terrestrial, and is no longer a
term belonging to any existentialism. I must stress that there is no hint of
existentialism in Sicre's painting; much less does his work express any of the nostalgic form of
"other-worldliness" that Surrealism represented for Europe. Let us be suspicious
of this European metaphor for the event and advent of the "new," and be wary of
the status of any group that proclaims itself the representative of a cultural
avant-garde. Here in the caves of L.A., which are no longer the caves of Lascaux, within a
situation we could roughly call multi-cultural, there could only be several avant-gardes, and
no longer <i>one</i> which could ever lay claim to the event and ad-vent of the new as its
exclusive "property." <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>In place of an avant-garde with its <i>artist-genius</i> (the figure of a dark and
latent Christian theology that still haunts European aesthetics), Sicre revises the
primitive cultural figure of <i>artist-shaman </i>(or artist-medium), to artist as
extra-terrestrial, both the sender, yet strangely, also the representative subject of the
community that is being addressed. We have here a form of artistic communication that can
no longer be comprehended by the bi-polarity of the instances: the addresser-artist and
addressee-spectator, or "public." Therefore, not only does the encounter
outlined above become an explicit subject of many of Sicre's paintings, where it unfolds
within a fluid continuum of different plastic and cultural representations, but it
situates the very position of the spectator before the work of art as a moment of this
encounter between human and what is beyond or otherwise than human. For Sicre, then, the
art-work itself occupies the position of the extra-terrestrial in the
"face-to-face" encounter with the human; that is, "it faces" the
spectator and communicates an event that is in some ways "unspeakable" and
"unpresentable" from the perspective of the normal organization of human
sensibility. At the same time that the event of this encounter with the art-work
represents an "alienation" of normal sensibility, however, it also invites the
spectator to enter into relationship with this experience and undergo a transformation of the
sensibility that the experience of the artwork engenders--in short, to "welcome the
alien," the extra-terrestrial.<p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Finally, we must ask what collective form do these presentiments take? What is their
shape, or collective sentience? Why does this encounter between the human and the
extra-terrestrial art-work necessarily imply the presence of another rhythm or atmosphere
of presentation, the demand of another sensibility that is set over against the human
habit of thinking and feeling? We have already traced the outlines of both Sicre’s
subject and his audience in the form of communication that takes place around the cultural
narratives of the "visitation." We can find a further glimpse of what this
"public" might look like and how they communicate in the painting "The Tree
of Knowledge," where we see the diagram of this alien intelligence in what could be
called the tendril-head system. This is a more crepuscular translation of the human
cerebral cortex outside the "mental space" of the cranium. It involves the
metamorphosis of the hair into the extension of the nerves and maps a new apparatus of
communication-receptivity of thoughts, feelings, and affects which dissolves the significance
of the voice. The hair, in Sicre's painting, points to a finer system of communication
than the human has, as of yet, invented. This immediately invokes the image of a more
complex and supple collectivity than ours (no longer formed from the segmentation between
the individual and the group, or between the artist-sender and the public-receiver), as
depicted here in the exfoliation of the rings into faces and limbs. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Here, we might see that the importance of the face and the hand for Sicre points to the
continuum of the encounters mentioned above. Every face necessarily implies the presence
of another, who is facing, but not necessarily seen. The face in the encounter, the face
to face of the visitation, implies either the meeting which takes place apart from others,
or the meeting of an individual with an other who represents another collectivity, or the
fluid form of such meetings which unfold in a community. This anomalous collectivity of
the face exfoliated in the gesture of greeting, is heightened by the specifically human
obsession with the face: whether in the mask worn by the lover, the face in the distance
whose detail is still beyond the circumspection of recognition, a group which collates its
possible forms of expression in a serially facial traits. Here, the face unfolds
quasi-organically out of the encounter, becomes multiple. The other face, however, the one
not presented, stares back from its place of vision, where it looks on, blank,
expressionless, serene; either the trace of an ancient community, or a sign, a mirror,
between us and a future which moves away at the speed of light. It is not surprising to
see here why art has always been obsessed with such encounters, and it would not be too
difficult to detect an alien presence even in the landscapes of Cezanne. <i>Nothing but
extra-terrestrials! Nothing but U.F.O. s</i> (and even before the invention of science
fiction where the alien suffers a particularly derogatory representation similar to that
of the native in Victorian novels or American Westerns). Thus, behind every encounter, of
which the art-work itself is a sign, there is another collectivity of which the encounter
itself is only the event, or the trace, of its arrival. Such encounters have always
happened, and they are happening <i>here and now</i>. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>In a conversation, Sicre once explained the procession of these encounters in his work
as the transmigration of souls in a culture where the soul is a component of its physical
science and not, as in ours, a metaphysical expression of time--something we perhaps are
approaching in the unified field theories of contemporary physics. <i>So the neighboring
could include the furthest dimension which arrives by an un-heard of velocity. </i>This
announces the arrival of another perspective that, up until today, has been too large to
be contained in our time. All time, up till now, and including the work of Heidegger, is
homocentric, based upon the embryonic nuclear clock of one species as subjective form of
experience. The ad-vent of an extra-terrestrial perspective, however, is the
dis-orientation of human time by the concrete duration crossed in welcoming the alien.
Again, this proposes the riddle of the sphinx under alien perspective, since we are still
creatures stuck to our proximity, who calculate the distances only in resemblance, and
whose conception of the neighboring could only be the nearest group, the closest nation,
the proximate race, the identical sex, the same species, and so on. From this angle we
could question a presentiment as the relation of velocity and no longer of form: it is no
longer the shape of the river, but its speed, that dissolves and carries along the forms
within it. A human, particularly in its evolution, moves by accretion at a slow and
laborious pace as if weighed down by the viscosity of its centuries. So it happens that a
being who approaches from a different composition of light and gravitation and speed,
would appear to be anomalous--perhaps a strange and unequal hybrid of sexual and racial
traits<i>-</i>-made up of an impossible, almost unbearable, remoteness.
Outside our <i>sentiendum</i>,
what was formerly called the unconscious, now finds a different speed and another point of
origin. <p></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>I have traced only a few components in Jorgé Sicre's painting of the encounter and the
presentiment of community that is still impossible under the current conditions of
communication (i.e. the system of human receptivity). It is for this reason, that the
nature of this encounter, like those reported in popular literature of the U.F.O., can
only take place in a certain relation to the secret. It is for this reason that we still
must be circumspect, cautious of "publicity" (as Kant called those forms of
openness which necessarily require an obsessive vigilance of the police). The reason that
speaks to Sicre, somewhere in the caves of L.A., tells him to record the history of the
human from the perspective of the extra-terrestrial, or of the in-human. Perhaps we have
here the figure of a new Oedipus who wakes up under an alien sky, and having forgotten the
question, smiles and reaches over tenderly to remove a few strands of his hair that have
fallen into the sphinx's eye.<p></li>
