<h1>Deconstructing the Great Chain of Being</h1>

<p><i>For Huston Smith</i></p>
<HR size=1>
<ol start=2>

<IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/L.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="L" ALIGN="LEFT">et me begin with a fact that has continued to surprise me for nearly twenty years. Many of the world’s great mystics, regardless of their cultural and intellectual traditions, have advocated versions of the Great Chain of Being. There are notable and important differences in the particular theories introduced, but the fact remains that the Great Chain provides the ontological foundation (or superstructure) for the great majority of mystics. Similarly, many theorists of the Great Chain of Being (if not all) explicitly articulate a commitment to the experiential reality and ontological significance of mystical experience. The connection between the
Great Chain of Being and mysticism is indeed so pervasive and runs so deep that
Huston Smith has suggested that these two positions are fundamentally
identical.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>I find this fact surprising because
it seems to me that there is (and ought to be) a profound tension between any
Great Chain metaphysics and any claim to mystical experience. This tension grows between the commitment of
a Great Chain theory to a more-or-less elaborate hierarchical conception of
reality and the commitment of mysticism to the significance of an experience
(whether of “union” or of “emptiness” does not seem to matter) in which the
hierarchies of ontology no longer seem necessary or important.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>I know of no better illustration of
this philosophical tension than that found throughout the <i>Enneads</i> of
Plotinus. For example, in his important
and rather early treatise, “On the Good or the One” (<i>Ennead</i> VI.9 [9]),
we see this tension reflected in the deeply paradoxical status of
“centering.” On the one hand, it is
clear here and throughout Plotinus’ work that the moral impetus of his thought
is towards a centering of the soul on the fundamental realities--ultimately the
One itself--which already exist within it.
Thus, in chapter 8 of VI.9, Plotinus compares the One to a center,
around which souls and gods circle, and he then describes the goal of the
individual soul as follows: “...we
lift ourselves up by the part which is not submerged in the body and by this
join ourselves at our own centers to something like the center of all things,
just as the centers of the greatest circles join the center of the encompassing
sphere, and we are at rest” (lines 18-22).<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>On the other hand, it is also clear
that this very movement of centering the soul ultimately entails an at least
temporary loss of self, a loss of the capacities that appear to make us what we
are, and ultimately a loss of distinction from the One. In the previous chapter of the same
treatise, for example, Plotinus insists that the soul must make itself
“formless” (<i>aneideon</i>) to get in touch with the equally formless One
(VI.9.7.8-16) and goes on to argue that this involves the soul’s ultimately
“ignoring” all outward things, including itself (lines 16-23). In the final, and most extraordinary,
chapter of this remarkable treatise, Plotinus goes even further, describing the
seer in mystical experience by way of an apophatic rejection of each of the
three parts of the soul familiar from Plato’s <i>Republic</i>:<P></li>

<blockquote>
He was one himself, with no
distinction in himself either in relation to himself
or to other things--for there was no movement in him and he had no emotion (<i>thumos</i>), no
desire (<i>epithumia</i>) for anything else when
he had made the ascent--but there was not even any reason (<i>logos</i>) or thought (<i>noesis</i>),
and he himself (<i>autos</i>) was not there, if we must even say this; but he was as if carried away or possessed by
a god, in a quiet solitude and
a state of calm, not turning away anywhere in his
being and not busy about himself, altogether at rest and having become a kind of rest. (VI.9.11.8-16)
</blockquote>

The import of this passage is that the movement of <i>centering</i> the soul
apparently leads to the soul’s very <i>removal</i> from the scene.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The tension to which I am trying to
call attention might be described in a number of other ways. It is, for example, surely identical to that
familiar tension between kataphatic and apophatic theology, where the often
baroque hierarchies of <i>kataphasis</i> seem to be cut adrift by the much more
arid negations of <i>apophasis</i>. In
a contemporary context, the tension between the Great Chain of Being and
mysticism, between ontological and experiential approaches to the claims of the
spiritual traditions is (paradoxically enough) perhaps most clearly felt in the
contrast between Steven Katz’s constructivist approach to mysticism and what I
would call the “pre-constructivist” approach advocated (if not elaborated) by Donald Rothberg.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> For the constructivists, any claim about
spiritual reality or about mystical experience is necessarily constructed in
and out of a cultural context, which context profoundly shapes and determines
the character of that tradition’s spiritual life. I suggest that the constructivist shares with the theorist of the
Great Chain of Being a commitment to the “non-negotiable” centrality of
metaphysical descriptions of reality and metaphysically grounded analyses of
individuals’ experiences of that reality. This is surely the ultimate import of the constructivists’ insistence on
“mediation.” In contrast, pre-constructivist
thinkers like Robert Forman and Daniel Brown--whom Rothberg has rather
misleadingly described as “deconstructionists”<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>--call
attention to the centrality within the great mystical traditions of a
commitment to the importance of “cutting away” or “forgetting” the categories
and structures by means of which reality has so regularly been characterized. This is surely the ultimate basis for the
interest in the last decade in the problem of “pure consciousness.”<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font> In recent commentary on Plotinus
this tension between metaphysical theory and experiential mysticism has been
handled in different ways. Thus, Pierre
Hadot tends to treat the tension as an ineluctable dimension of the
paradoxical, existential condition of the human self. Hadot writes: “We only <i>are</i>
that of which we are aware, and yet we are aware of having been more fully <i>ourselves</i>
precisely in those moments when, raising ourselves to a higher level of inner
simplicity, we lose our self-awareness.”<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> In contrast, Michael Sells treats this
tension as a condition and as a product of the peculiar “mode of discourse”
characteristic of Plotinus.<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
Sells describes his approach to
Plotinus’ text in the following terms: “A more apophatic reading of the <i>Enneads</i> will focus upon those
moments in which such fixed hierarchies and directionalities are displaced or
transformed. Reference to the one...
devolves into an infinite regress in which every referent recedes beyond the
name that would designate it. Language
becomes indefinite and open-ended. No
closure is reached. Each saying demands
a further unsaying.”<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font> I would argue that both Hadot and
Sells effectively capture central dimensions of Plotinus’ philosophical
worldview and methodology. However,
neither the existential nor the grammatical-rhetorical approach to the <i>Enneads</i>
successfully illuminates what might be called the “experience of
self-deconstruction” illustrated in the final chapter of <i>Ennead</i> VI.9.<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> This experience partakes of both the
existential and the grammatical--such is, in fact, part of the character of
every human experience--but it also appears to transcend both the passive acceptance
of paradox and the unending back-and-forth of saying and unsaying. Indeed, Plotinus’ language here powerfully
describes an experience of a certain sort of satisfaction, a certain kind of
intellectual and experiential peace: “...but he was as if carried away or possessed by a god, in a quiet solitude
and a state of calm, not turning away anywhere in his being and not busy about
himself, altogether at rest and having become a kind of rest” (VI.9.11.12-16).<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>What, then, can we say about the
experience of self-deconstruction in general and, in particular, about the
significance of this kind of experience for theorists of the Great Chain of
Being?<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>The first thing that seems clear is
that the process of self-deconstruction is itself thoroughly mediated by the
cultural context of the tradition within which the deconstruction is carried
out. What this means is that the very
process of self-deconstruction is inconceivable apart from a particular
delineation and articulation of the nature of reality. If the <i>individual</i> <i>soul</i> is, for
example, to cut away all <i>movement</i>, <i>emotion</i>, <i>desire</i>, <i>reason</i>,
<i>thought</i>, and <i>self</i>, in order to make its <i>ascent</i> to the <i>One</i>
or the <i>Good</i>, it is equally important that the individual soul have an
adequate background in the (roughly) Platonic psychology and ontology that
ground Plotinus’ disciplinary imperatives. In other words, a very specific articulation of the Great Chain of Being
is itself inscribed in the procedures by means of which the individual might
attain to the mystical experience from which the Great Chain may no longer seem
an essential or even true description of reality. From this perspective, then, it seems that the
self-deconstruction characteristic of mysticism is perfectly compatible with a
constructivist approach<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>
and that mysticism and the Great Chain do make a natural and even essentially
related couple.    <P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>This suggests that the Great Chain’s
ultimate experiential validation comes precisely in the experience of the
Chain’s falling to pieces around the link of the individual soul. An important corollary of this is that the
Great Chain of Being--or at least some well-developed and articulated
ontology--is ineliminable from any account of the process of mysticism. In other words, a psychologistic
interpretation of the mystical path simply cannot do justice to the
metaphysical implications of the process of self-deconstruction.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>If the process of
self-deconstruction is clearly enough inseparable from a particular tradition’s
psychology and ontology, what--if anything--can be said about the nature of the
individual’s <i>experience</i> of self-deconstruction (i.e., the experience
attending the completion of the process considered above)? Daniel Brown argues that there is at least a
“basic moment of enlightenment” which escapes any influence of the tradition
within which that moment of enlightenment has been realized and which he
characterizes as an “awareness” which is in some sense “freed from
psychological structure.”<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> Such a state of awareness is presumably that
described by Toshihiko Izutsu as “non-intentional consciousness,” a kind of
consciousness so radically nondual that “...exactly the same propositional
content may be expressed interchangeably by four linguistically different
sentences: (1) ‘I see the mountain’,
(2) ‘The mountain sees me’, (3) ‘The mountain sees the mountain’, (4) ‘I see
myself’.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
title="">[11]</a> In a similar key, Plotinus argues in a
densely textured passage: “But perhaps
one should not say ‘will see’, but ‘was seen’, if one must speak of these as
two, the seer and the seen, and not both as one--a bold statement.... For this reason the vision is hard to put
into words. For how could one announce
that as another when he did not see, there when he had the vision, another, but
one with himself” (VI.9.10.11-21)?<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>What exactly are we to make of this
experience of nonduality? At one level,
it is surely clear that <i>descriptions</i> of this experience remain
intimately tied to the cultural (psychological and ontological) traditions
within which the descriptions have developed.
Thus, Plotinus’ tortuous language remains redolent both of the mystery
cults and of that utterly Platonic vocabulary which he simultaneously
deconstructs and enshrines. Similarly,
Izutsu’s fourfold unfolding of ‘I see the mountain’ evokes and reinterprets the
fourfold schema of negation by means of which Nagarjuna subjects to radical
deconstruction the entire conceptual apparatus of Mahayana Buddhism. In general, it would seem that descriptions
of the process and results of self-deconstruction will always betray their
cultural and philosophical roots.<P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>Does this mean, then, that <i>apophasis</i>
is doomed to reinscribe within itself precisely the <i>kataphasis</i> that it
aims to undermine? Does this in turn
entail that the apophatic impulse of mysticism is ultimately
self-negating? In his
characteristically rigorous and subtle essay, “How to Avoid Speaking: Denials,” Jacques Derrida examines in
Pseudo-Dionysius and Meister Eckhart a tension that runs parallel to the
tension I have been examining here. Commenting
on the ways in which metaphysical theory reappears within the very heart of
negative theology, Derrida notes that “The theologian must practice not a
double language, but the double inscription of his knowledge: mystical and demonstrative.”<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> However, he goes on to insist that “Even if
one speaks and says nothing, even if an apophatic discourse deprives itself of
meaning or of an object, it takes place.”<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> The “place” or <i>topos</i> in which <i>apophasis</i>
takes place is, according to Derrida, the speech act of prayer. Of crucial importance to Derrida’s argument
is the fact--noted by Aristotle in <i>De Interpretatione</i> 17a4-5--that
prayer is neither true nor false, although it is meaningful. Because of this, the metaphysical or
psychological claims made in the course of prayer are effectively indeterminate
in their truth-value, although such claims are perfectly meaningful. Derrida devotes much of his essay to showing
how the strongly apophatic passages of Dionysius and Eckhart are actually
inscribed within more global discourses of prayer, thus relativizing the
negations of apophatic theology to the truth-limbo of prayer.<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> Rarely one to make grand assertions himself,
Derrida ends “How to Avoid Speaking:
Denials” with a series of questions: 
“If there were a purely pure experience of prayer, would one need
religion and affirmative or negative theologies? Would one need a supplement of prayer? But if there were no supplement, if quotation did not bend
prayer, if prayer did not bend, if it did not submit to writing, would a
theiology be possible? Would a theology
be possible?”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"
title="">[15]</a><P></li>

<font class=footer><li></font>If we bring Derrida’s provocative
analysis to bear on Plotinus’ description of the experience of
self-deconstruction, I suggest that we understand his sometimes tortured,
sometimes ecstatic Greek neither as symptomatic of existential resignation (as
Hadot might see it) nor as symptomatic of a drive towards unending dialectic
(as Sells might see it). Rather,
Plotinus’ texts read as complex discourses of prayer addressed to his disciples
and readers, but even more clearly addressed to that divine Other he generally
describes as “the One.” It is in
continual relation to this Other that Plotinus’ metaphysical theorizing and his
spiritual practice find their meaning and their promise of peace. Thus, Plotinus concludes “On the Good or the
One” with a statement characterizing the life of the philosophical sage, and
yet this all-too-famous statement really articulates that for which the sage
hopes, that the promise of which has been held out to him/her, that for which
s/he prays:    <P></li>

<blockquote>
And when one falls from the vision,
he wakes again the virtue in himself,
and considering himself set in order and beautiful by these virtues he will again be lightened and
come through virtue to Intellect and
wisdom and through wisdom to that Good.
This is the life of gods and
of godlike and blessed men, deliverance from the things of this world, a life which takes no delight in
the things of this world, escape in
solitude to the solitary. (VI.9.11.45-51)
</blockquote>

<font class=footer><li></font>I
believe it would be a mistake to read “the life of gods and of godlike and
blessed men” as a simple, factual description of the sage’s life, as an account
of what it is like to be enlightened.
This is rather a promise of a kind of experience--the experience of
self-deconstruction--for which it is incumbent upon the philosopher to pray. The calm tone of Plotinus’ closing suggests
as well that coming to see the work of philosophy as prayer is itself the sign of
enlightenment.     <P></li>
