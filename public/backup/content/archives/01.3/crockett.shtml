<p align=left style='text-align: left; line-height: 100%'><i>Religion is about a certain about. What religion is

about, however, remains obscure for it is never quite there--nor is it exactly

not there. Religion is about what is always slipping away. It is, therefore,

impossible to grasp what religion is about--unless, perhaps, what we grasp is

the impossibility of grasping... This strange slipping away is no mere

disappearance but a withdrawal that allows appearances to appear.</i></p>

<ol start=2>

<p style='line-height: 100%'><i><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/O.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="O" ALIGN="LEFT"></i>ne of the significant problems for

both understanding and living today involves the unrestrained proliferation of

capital. In traditional Christianity, the prohibition against usury means that

charging money for time is sinful because humans presume to buy and sell time,

which is deemed God’s possession. Of course, we could not conceive of modern

society and economy without the practice of charging interest. One possibility

for religious studies then, is to use economic concepts to understand religious

phenomena, broadly following Marx. Here I am thinking of Mark Taylor’s essay

“Discrediting God,” as well as some of Derrida’s philosophical reflections in

“White Mythology” and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Specters of Marx</i>.

The other side of this agenda would involve using religious and theological

terms to critique and understand the workings of our economy. Here one could

think of the market as God, and grapple with notions of investment, speculation

and faith. It is intriguing to explore the multivalent resonance of words such

as interest, speculation and credit in both philosophical-religious and

economic contexts.</p>



  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">On the other hand, any discussions

of financial economy must be supplemented with the notion of a psychic economy.

Here a psychic economy, following the work of Freud, involves a repetition of a

financial economy, but it is far less evidently rational or objective in its

workings. One can read Deleuze and Guattari’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>Anti-Oedipus</i> and Lyotard’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Libidinal

Economy</i> as efforts to articulate a relation between Marx and Freud, as well

as attempts to intervene into the workings of both economies.<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">Unfortunately, it is increasingly

difficult, if not impossible, to justify religious studies in relation to any

notion of financial economy. One does not engage in the study of religion in

the hopes that it will “pay off” in the literal sense of the word, and even if

graduate students desire to pursue religious studies they are warned stridently

by publications such as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York

Times</i> that such a field is not in their best interests, that is, if they

want a job or profession that supports their livelihood.<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">So the only reasonable way to

explain an interest in religious studies is by reference to psychic investments

and desires, which are necessarily less rational than financial ones. These may

be desires for knowledge, thinking, self-exploration and growth, recognition,

and faith, and these may compensate or overcompensate for other desires and

other economic considerations. We should not disavow the awareness that at some

level the choice of religious studies is contingent and arbitrary, depending on

personal experiences, inclinations, and constraints. At some point we make a

choice for religious studies rather than history, philosophy, biochemistry,

nursing, seminary, etc., and we dig in and build a trench which we defend

(perhaps even to the death). From a broader perspective, though, the situation

of religious studies in its vulnerability is an extreme one and can function as

a metonym for the humanities, liberal arts, the academy, higher education as a

whole, etc. Here religious studies represents a paradigm of crisis in our

culture which generally that of education. Religion/education/cultural

knowledge is recognized as crucial for our society, and yet, at the same time,

the fact that it does not pay off in an immediate short-term sense leaves it

desolate and forlorn, cut off from the immense wealth generated by our

businesses. What is the relationship of so-called useless knowledge—theoretical

religious studies--to useful knowledge—business or practical pursuits?<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">Here at the crux of an aporia we

could elaborate two strategies, taken from two major ethical theories,

utilitarianism and deontology. Given an investment in religious studies,

liberal arts, or theoretical knowledge as a whole, one may choose to assert

broadly utilitarian arguments, which take a rational and logical form, as to

the long-term payoff of such studies, such as promoting a better and more

educated society, a more responsible and moral citizen, a more intelligent,

critical and efficient businessperson, etc. Arguments from utility usually can

be cast in terms of value, broadly speaking. The alternative deontological

approach, is to articulate a demand intrinsic to the subject matter itself.

Unfortunately, many of our arguments for studying religion appear deontological

in relation to the broader society, which only recognizes a logic of financial

economy, however utilitarian such reasons may appear from the standpoint of a

psychic economy. Despite Kant’s Herculean efforts, and in some way because of

them, any extreme position of deontology appears necessarily irrational because

reason follows upon utility in any economic model. Of course, the advantage of

the deontological approach is that it allows the possibility of an outside of

economy, or at least a critical approach towards economy/utility/rationality

and every value which is set in those ironclad terms. Can deontology rupture or

transcend economy, broadly speaking? Or does its implicit idealism merely serve

to reinforce the status quo economic situation by wishing it away? Should we

rather pursue a strategy of acknowledging the ubiquity of economic situations

or power, materiality and utility and then attempt to intervene realistically

from within that economy?<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">Here I have tried to trace two

strands, which in their entanglement form a knot, which defines a locus for

religious studies. In order to render some specificity to this duality, I want

to turn briefly to Socrates/Plato, a dizzying entanglement if ever there was

one. In the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Euthyphro</i>, Socrates

questions Euthyphro concerning holiness, or piety. As is generally well known,

Socrates asks what a quality or characteristic is in itself, apart from any

particular instance or example. Euthyphro initially replies that his particular

situation, prosecuting his father for murder despite familial ties, is holy,

which does not answer Socrates’ question. “I asked you for that special feature

through which all things are holy. For you were in agreement, surely, that it

was by virtue of a single standard that all unholy things are unholy and all

holy things are holy” (6d). When Euthyphro replies that what is holy is what is

agreeable to the gods, Socrates asks whether something is approved by the gods

because it is holy, or holy because approved by the gods (10a). This is akin to

the famous medieval dispute whether God is constrained to do what is good

(Thomistic), or whether whatever God desires thereby becomes good (Scotist).

The former restricts God’s omnipotence, while the latter introduces the

terrifying possibility of a malevolent God. Both Socrates and Euthyphro affirm

that what is holy is approved by the gods by virtue of its possessing the

quality of holiness. This move displaces the centrality of the gods from the

determination of what holiness is, and Socrates further restricts holiness to a

species of justice. Holiness becomes “that part of the just which is…concerned

with looking after the gods” (12e). Looking after the gods concerns commerce or

exchange with the gods, a “science of sacrifice [donation] and prayer

[request].” Socrates draws the relentless conclusion that “holiness would be a

kind of skill in trading between gods and men” (14e). This is of course a

circular argument, which does not escape the logic of exchange, because then

holiness is generated through and by approval of the gods (and humans), which

is precisely the standpoint rejected earlier in the dialogue. This disturbing

conclusion is what prompts Socrates to try to begin again to discover what

holiness is, despite his impending trial, and Euthyphro to think of somewhere

else he urgently needs to be and take off.<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">Besides an interesting (I hope)

interlude, this reading of Plato’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Euthyphro</i>

intends to illustrate what I mean by studying religion as studying economies.

In an objective sense, studying religion is the study of various

economies--psychic, financial, ideological and theological. It deals with

interchange or commerce between gods and human beings. Here one can grapple

with the materialities and idealities of faith, investments, speculation,

sacrifice, prayer, risk, credit and debt, obligation, contracts, in sum,

business! Such economies may be alternately general or restricted, but at some

level must be investigated and understood in terms of utility, at least

presumed or implied. The profound difficulty of studying <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>religion</i> in this sense as opposed to studying anything else, is how

to delimit holiness or the sacred from justice, or whether one can separate

commerce between humans and gods from commerce solely among human beings. This

may or may not be possible, and depending on the solution there may or may not

be a special object or phenomenon called religion.<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">The other strand, which does <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> correspond to what I have loosely

called deontology, is the subjective side of studying religion. The subjective

aspect of the study of religion, which supplements and pressures the objective

side above, must understand the economic investments and motivations of

scholars themselves, and their implications in their object of study also in

utilitarian terms. The subjective side of studying religion can be referenced

with the term desire, although Socrates calls it prayer, which is a more

explicitly religious term. What are our desires in studying religion? Do we

want truth, God, money, security, information, recognition, the satisfaction of

proving other people wrong, the intensity of the conflict and the clash of

ideas in conferences and journals? The subjective side forms the other strand.<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">Now, what I call deontology, is not

actually a strand or an other thing, but rather the form of study itself, that

is, the logic of classification, marking, or signification. This “logic”

appears in both material and ideal forms, psychic and financial economies. This

logic of form has no rational justification that grounds it, it is <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ungrund</i>, in Heidegger’s sense. What is

grounding has itself no ground, and thus appears as abyss, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>Abgrund</i>. In the case of the Socratic dialogue, the structure of the

dialogue itself, what Plato elsewhere calls the dialectic, or in a specific

sense the intensive searching questioning called the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>elenchus</i>, refers to the back and forth play which generates the

argument and its presuppositions. Another example would be what Kant calls form

abstracted from all content. The form generates the meaning, and here I am

assimilating form to the Greek <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>logos</i>,

but we should also bear in mind the Polynesian <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>tabu</i>, which means marked thoroughly. In a more anthropological

sense, something which is marked out is sacred, set apart, and this marking of

necessity will have economic motivations and consequences, but the issue here

is the process of marking out and setting apart, the system or principle of

classification in a Lévi-Straussian sense.<p>

</li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">In this specific deontological

sense the study of religion would be what I call a secular theology. A secular

theology examines and interrogates the economic form or law of religious

phenomena, but not solely in order to understand it. Here the theoretical

component of the study of religion generates form itself, or creates

theological concepts. Keep in mind that such concepts need not be confessional

in relation to any church or creed, and that the term secular, or what Gabriel

Vahanian calls the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>saeculum</i>, is by no

means the opposite of sacred, but rather refers to a shared world of human

experience. The creation of theological concepts is analogous to Deleuze and

Guattari’s definition of philosophy as the creation of concepts in <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>What is Philosophy?</i> The study of

religion, or secular theology, involves at least the creation of concepts of

religion. More explicitly, and more demandingly, it involves the creation of <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>religious</i> concepts of religion. Here

most proponents of the sociological study of religion back away in horror and

cling desperately to the ropes themselves. However, if religion is to be a

viable or significant field, warranting investment or demanding respect, it

requires the generation of theoretical concepts specific to the field, These

concepts are not found but must be created (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ex

nihilo</i>?). Who has the time these days to create concepts of God? Who has

the courage or the audacity to create <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>divine</i>

concepts of God? And anyway, what would that even mean, despite Augustine’s

definition of theology as God’s thinking of God? The stakes are even higher, if

not more absurd, given fact that we live in a time in which God is dead.

Deleuze’s famous quote from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Logic of

Sense</i> deserves careful study in this context:</li>



<blockquote>



<p style="line-height: 100%">It is our epoch which has discovered theology. One

no longer needs to believe in God. We seek rather the “structure,” that is, the

form which may be filled with beliefs, but the structure has no need to be

filled in order to be called “theological.” Theology is now the science of nonexisting

entities, the manner in which these entities—divine or anti-divine, Christ or

Antichrist—animate language and make for it this glorious body which is divided

into disjunctions.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

</blockquote>

<li>

<p style='line-height: 100%'>In his essay on “Faith and

Knowledge,” Derrida distinguishes two experiences which he claims are equally

and primordially religious: </p>



<ol start=1 type=A>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>

  <p style="line-height: 100%">the

     experience of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>belief</i>, on the one

     hand (believing or credit, the fiduciary or the trustworthy in the act of

     faith, fidelity, the appeal to blind confidence, the testimonial that is

     always beyond proof, demonstrative reason, intuition); and</li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>

  <p style="line-height: 100%">the

     experience of the unscathed, of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sacredness</i>

     or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holiness</i>, on the other.<a

     style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<p>

  <![endif]></span></a></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>

<p style='line-height: 100%'>Towards the end of the essay,

Derrida contrasts “a double postulation: on the one hand, the absolute respect

of life…; and on the other, the no less universal sacrificial vocation.”<a

style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></a>

The latter is called mechanics, because its technique, the reproduction of

sacrifice, produces “the instance of the non-living…of the dead in the living.”<a

style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></a>

These two experiences must be distinguished but cannot be separated. Derrida

refers to Kantian dignity, the end in itself of a rational being, which is

“absolute value beyond all comparative market-price. This dignity of life can

only subsist beyond the present living being.” The absolute value of life

creates an excess beyond present life which is the space of and for death. The

fact that (present) life can be sacrificed for its ideal in an absolute sense

allows for a justification of killing what must not be killed. “This excess

above and beyond the living,” Derrida writes, “whose life only has absolute

value by being worth more than life, more than itself—this, in short, is what

opens the space of death that is linked to the automaton, to technics, the

machine….”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></a>

What Derrida calls the religious bond occurs within the knot of the two

economic strands--belief and the unscathed, prayer and holiness, life and

death. “It is there that the possibility of religion persists: the religious

bond between the value of life, its absolute ‘dignity’, and the theological

machine, the machine for making gods.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6'

href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></a>

This bond, along with our response, is both ambiguous and ambivalent, twisting

together what we know as morality and sacrality, in both positive and negative

terms, beyond the possibility of pulling the strands apart.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p style='line-height: 100%'>These two strands of life and

death, belief and holiness, or the distinction between the subjective and

objective aspects of the study of religion, are intertwined in a knot which

must be explained, if it can be explained, in terms of utility broadly

conceived. That is, utility exceeds and explains deontology, which it

imbricates and overlays. On the other hand, what I have called the form in

itself must be abstracted in thinking as an invisible locus or <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chora</i> which has no reality apart from

the knot. This form is always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quasi-deontological</i>

in the sense that it does not adhere to any utilitarian logic, and it is also

theological in the sense that I am describing here.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></a>

In Derrida’s essay, after maintaining religion as an ellipsis of sacrifice and

prayer, he creates a formal (not a spatial) distance from this knot, when he contends

that </p>



<p style='line-height: 100%; margin-left: .5in'>the gap between the opening of this

possibility (as a universal structure) and the determinate necessity of this or

that religion will always remain irreducible….Thus one can always criticize,

reject or combat, this or that form of sacredness or of belief, even of

religious authority, in the name of the most originary possibility.<a

style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></a></p>

</li>

<li>

<p style='line-height: 100%'>Derrida affirms as formal

possibility, that “thought in

general” would “retain the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>same</i>

resource as religion in general.” What Derrida calls thought in general is what

I am calling the possibility of a secular theology, or the form as locus for

the process of creating religious concept(ion)s. This form is both encapsulated

within and excessive in relation to all considerations of economy. Studying

religion economically situates and contextualizes a discipline, and yet that

very study itself is excessive and theological, at least formally or

residually. We study religion in order to learn the economic relationships of

prayer and sacrifice, to intervene into the economies of gods and humans, and

above all to create new possibilities for thinking. </p>

pp.58-59. This is similar to Caputo’s formulation of “religion without religion.”

However, this formulation must not be understood simplistically, as if one

could construct a religion purified of content, dogma and history; this is a

facile understanding which fails to do justice to Derrida’s thought as well as

Caputo’s representation of it. If Derrida’s religion is purely possible and

absolutely indeterminate, then this can only be thought in intrinsic relation

to particular and determinate religions, as Derrida emphasizes in “Faith and

Knowledge.” “Religion” is always both with and without religion. See John D.
