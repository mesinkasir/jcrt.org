Castoriadis, who was born in Greece

but worked mainly in France, was a practicing psychoanalyst, cultural and

political theorist, and philosopher. Recently, Castoriadis’ work has been

enjoying some wider recognition, and much of it has been translated into

English in the past decade. Castoriadis has developed some seminal inquiries into

the inter-relations of subjectivity and culture, focusing specifically on

issues of heteronomy and autonomy. In the course of these inquiries, which in

my view are themselves highly relevant for contemporary religious reflection,

Castoriadis formulates some pointed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>critical</span></i> arguments concerning the status

of religion in relation to these issues. There have also been several other

thinkers emerging on the French scene in the past fifteen years or so, quite

different in style and background from Castoriadis, who share some of his core

concerns with the over-riding issues of autonomy and heteronomy in the

relations between individual and society. Here, I will mainly draw upon some

ideas of Marcel Gauchet, whose notion of a “split” within religion will be used

to develop a critical augmentation of Castoriadis’ arguments concerning

religion and heteronomy.</span></p>





  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>In his earlier work, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>The Imaginary Institution of Society</span></i>,

Castoriadis established two inter-related notions: the “radical imaginary,”

which describes the open-ended creative and representational capacities of

human beings, and the “social imaginary,” constituting the underlying

principles, laws, values, and worldviews of any given culture. As he states:

“History is impossible and inconceivable outside of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>productive</span></i> or <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>creative

imagination</span></i>, outside of what we have called the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>radical imaginary</span></i>... .”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn1' href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></a>

Importantly, Castoriadis adds that this faculty “includes the dimension that

idealist philosophers called freedom, and which is more appropriately called <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>indeterminacy</span></i>...

.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></a>

This “radical imaginary” is posited as the basis of, and yet as distinct from,

the social imaginary significations of particular cultures. It reflects the

human capacity to imagine (and hence to think) otherwise than what is; this is

why notions of indeterminacy and openness are emphasized. These terms indicate

a quality of the imagination quite specific to human beings, whereby

representational capacity is at least partially disconnected from functional

and utilitarian referents (Castoriadis calls this “defunctionalization”); this

allows a degree of autonomy to the imagination that forms the basis for

creative activity and critical reflection.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3'

href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></a></span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>However, the radical imaginary does not take

shape in isolation, apart from shared imaginary institutions. The

inter-dependency of self, others and society is essential to Castoriadis’

understanding of autonomy, and links it with ethical (and possibly with

religious) reflection. Reciprocally, every individual is formed within

structures he or she does not control and is at best only partially aware of,

and this is related to the problem of heteronomy. These collective structures

are described as “the creation of each historical period, its singular manner

of living, of seeing and conducting its own existence, its world, ...the basis

for articulating what does matter and what does not... [which] is nothing other

than the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>imaginary</span></i>

of the society or the period considered.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4'

href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></a> I should note

that Castoriadis’ social or institutional imaginary shares features of Jacques

Lacan’s notion of the “symbolic.” (It is likewise quite different from Lacan’s

imaginary, which is associated with narcissism.) Each refers to the socially

constituted laws and linguistic structures internalized by subjects, enabling

differentiated, higher-order reflective and ethical activity. Thus Castoriadis

also refers to “the institution of a world of significations,” linking the

imaginary with language in a way that parallels Lacan’s symbolic order.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></a>

Having said this, however, Castoriadis is in fact often at pains to

differentiate his ideas from Lacan’s. For instance, he argues that the Lacanian

symbolic tends to become a “trans-historical” category,<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn6' href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></a> and that this

serves to prevent “all possible distinction between a ‘de facto validity’ and a

‘de jure validity’.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn7' href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></a>

He also argues that the Lacanian model focuses too much on “structure,” thereby

excluding what is essential: the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>temporality</span></i> of social institutions.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn8' href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></a>

In the present context, it is not possible to pass judgement on these arguments

in terms of their fairness to Lacan. The point I want to stress is that, in

contrasting himself with Lacan, Castoriadis emphasizes social imaginary

institutions as specific, as historically and temporally constructed, and as

subject to critical analysis and possible transformation. This last point is

seen in the de facto/ de jure distinction, whereby Castoriadis invokes a

potentially “higher law” beyond those actually given in particular worlds of

established social significations. Here we might ask: What is at stake in this

critical distinction, and how does Castoriadis attempt to apply critical and

ethical criteria beyond the historically given ones of extant societies?</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Before pursuing these questions,<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I should also stress that “imaginary

significations” are constitutive of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>any</span></i> given society, even in eras of

advanced rationalization and technologization. Castoriadis emphasizes that

“paradoxically, ...despite or rather due to this extreme ‘rationalization’, the

life of the modern world is just as dependent on the imaginary as any archaic

or historical culture.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn9' href="#_edn9"

name="_ednref9" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></span></a>

There is no absolute divide between traditional and modernized<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>imaginary institutions; they simply take

different forms. The term Castoriadis coins and repeatedly uses to define the

specific mode of thinking and engaging the world in modern technological

societies is “ensemblistic-identitarian” reason. By this he means the attitude

that grasps reality as a world of things to be approached in

causal-deterministic and mechanistic terms. For Castoriadis, and this is a

crucial point for my larger arguments, the instrumental mode of reasoning and

functioning, however effective it may be in attaining certain practical ends,

is no more “objective,” no more free of conditioning assumptions, than any

other worldview. As he states, “as ensemblistic-identitarian, this type of

thought (‘reckoning’ and so on) has to be blind to its own axioms, its rules of

inference... .”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn10' href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></span></a>

Castoriadis also argues that, the more this type of “instrumental rationality”

holds sway, the less we have access to alternate “ultimate values” offered by

different cultures.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn11' href="#_edn11"

name="_ednref11" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![endif]></span></a>

Therefore, the perpetual problem and task is not the elimination of imaginary

frameworks, which is impossible, but rather fostering critical reflection on

how they function, in their specific social forms. Comparative, critical

analyses are crucial to this understanding, and the over-riding evaluative

criteria are those of autonomy and heteronomy, which now require some

discussion.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The relation between the radical or creative

imaginary, and the social imaginary of given cultures, is one wherein there is

both interdependence and tension; this is essential to Castoriadis’

understanding of autonomy. This interdependency indicates that autonomy cannot

be understood merely as defining abstracted, isolated individuals, but must

also be fostered on the social-political level of institutions.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn12' href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![endif]></span></a>

Although Castoriadis is very much in the humanist tradition, he has absorbed

and appropriated psychoanalytic and other views concerning both the inner

differentiation of the subject, and the formation of the subject through

inter-subjective and cultural interaction. These levels of autonomy appear in

Castoriadis’ argument that “a society is autonomous not only if it knows that

it makes its laws but also if it is up to the task of putting them into

question. Likewise...an individual is autonomous if that individual has been

able to instaurate another relation between its Unconscious, its past, the

conditions under which it lives–and itself as a reflective and deliberative

instance.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></span></a>

In each case, or on each level, the past, the “foundation” of our predominant

attitudes,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>needs to be brought into

awareness and held open to questioning and reflection. This is why Castoriadis

is such a strong advocate of democratic society, not in what he sees as the

superficial sense of elected representation, but in the deeper sense of opening

“a space where the activities of thinking and of politics lead to putting into

question again and again not only the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>given</span></i> forms of the social institution and

of the social representation of the world but the possible ground for <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>any</span></i>

such forms.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn14' href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></span></a>

Such inquiry into the foundations and assumptions shaping social and individual

worlds of meaning Castoriadis terms <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>reflection</span></i>, which, as he emphasizes,

requires multiplicity and differentiation that allow dialogue and questioning,

both within oneself and within society.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn15'

href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![endif]></span></a> With this,

it can be seen that autonomy and reflectiveness cannot be posited in any final

or substantive form, but indicate a continuing capacity and opportunity to

question and change in relation to extant social structures.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>This prioritization of autonomy, reflection,

and questioning is perhaps best understood in relation to their antithesis,

heteronomy. The nature of, and relationship between these opposed modalities

can be clarified by examining how, in one essay, Castoriadis formulates his

notion of autonomy in sharp contrast to that of the biologist Francisco Varela.

For Varela, autonomy refers to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>closed systems</span></i> that operate as much as

possible without reference to, or dependence upon anything outside of

themselves, which, like his collaborator Humberto Maturana, he refers to as

“autopoiesis” (self-making). In her fine analysis of their work, Katherine

Hayles summarizes the position of Maturana and Varela in stating that “it is

precisely closure that guarantees the subject will operate as an autonomous

individual.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn16' href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></span></a>

However, Hayles goes on to argue that “autopoietic theory, in its zeal to

construct an autonomous sphere of action for self-enclosing entities,

formulates a description that ironically describes autistic individuals more

accurately than it does normally responsive people.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn17' href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![endif]></span></a> Castoriadis

formulates a similar critique, arguing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>that “an extreme but very telling example of what would be the fullest

‘autonomy’ in Varela’s sense, and the fullest heteronomy in my sense, is that

of the psychotic person suffering from paranoia. This person has created once

and for all his own all-encompassing and totally rigid interpretative system,

and nothing can ever enter his world without being transformed according to the

rules of this system.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn18' href="#_edn18"

name="_ednref18" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></span></a>

Closure becomes heteronomy because, as in the example of psychosis, the person

is trapped within an interpretative world that is not challenged by alterity,

and which therefore cannot be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>questioned or changed</span></i>. In the same

context, Castoriadis briefly mentions “totalitarianism” as another (more

obvious) example of a closed, comprehensive interpretative system. He also

offers the view that heteronomy is manifest in “all religious societies, where

rules, principles, laws, meanings, etc., are posited as given once and for all,

and their unquestioned and unquestionable character is institutionally

guaranteed... .”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn19' href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[19]<![endif]></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This pejorative understanding of religion is

also based on its tendency toward “total explanation,” a point to which I will

return in some detail.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>For the moment, I want to emphasize that, in

contrast to closed systems of any kind, Castoriadis articulates autonomy in <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>open system</span></i>

and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>interactive</span></i>

terms. This view draws upon notions he sees as first emerging in ancient

Greece, and then again in Western Europe at the end of the Middle ages,

“whereby autonomy in the proper sense is created for the first time: autonomy

not as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>closure</span></i>

but as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>openness</span></i>.”

Castoriadis argues that “for the first time in the history of humanity... we

have here a being that brings openly into question its proper laws of

existence, its proper existing order.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn20'

href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[20]<![endif]></span></a> Castoriadis

is not arguing that autonomy means dispensing with laws, rather that laws, and

indeed all facets of the imaginary institutions of society, are capable of

being reflected upon, questioned, and changed. Moreover, this reflective

questioning does not spring spontaneously out of the “rational minds” of

individual subjects, but requires the “imaginary” in both forms. The radical

imaginary is a necessary feature of autonomous subjectivity because “the

absolute condition for the possibility of reflectiveness is the imagination”

which makes it possible to “see double, to see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>oneself</span></i> double, to see <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>oneself</span></i>

while seeing oneself as other.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn21' href="#_edn21"

name="_ednref21" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[21]<![endif]></span></a>

This single passage indicates that alterity is crucial to autonomy in several

ways. I need to be able to distance myself from the internalized social

structures shaping my attitudes, and to do this I need to interact with others.

Reciprocally, for this interaction to be effective, I must be able to step

outside of myself, to “see double” in order to place myself in the position of

an other. This is clearly not the instrumental capacity of

“ensemblistic-identitarian” reason as wielded by the isolated individual.

Rather, the sort of reflective ethical capacity Castoriadis describes emerges

from, as it were, the inner alterity of the radical imaginary.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The distinction between autonomy and

heteronomy becomes more pointed as Castoriadis argues that autonomy requires

the “instauration of a self-reflecting and deliberating subjectivity, which has

not become a pseudo-rational and socially ‘adapted’ machine but on the contrary

has recognized and freed the radical imagination lying at the core of the

psyche.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn22' href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[22]<![endif]></span></a>

The seemingly rational, socially adapted individual is in fact subject to

heteronomy in a form other than overt coercion. This is not the extreme form of

a closed individual world in autism or psychosis, nor is it confined to the

obvious forms of heteronomy in totalitarian societies. Rather, and more

encompassingly, heteronomy reflects the problem of closed modes of subjectivity

instituted in unquestioned conformity with predominant societal attitudes.

Castoriadis appropriates psychoanalytic language to describe this, stating that

the “ego is largely a social fabrication; it is designed to function in a given

social setting and to preserve, continue, and reproduce this setting–that is,

the institutions that created it.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn23' href="#_edn23"

name="_ednref23" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[23]<![endif]></span></a>

Heteronomy for Castoriadis does not simply mean external imposition of fixed

laws and norms; it also entails the internalization of institutions, via the

ego, which leads to what he calls “a mutilation of the radical imagination.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn24' href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[24]<![endif]></span></a>

This mutilation is further described in terms of the closure of imagination

correlated with socialization. “Through this social fabrication of the

individual the institution subjugates the singular imagination of the subject

and, as a general rule, lets it manifest only in and through dreaming,

phantasying, transgression, illness.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn25'

href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[25]<![endif]></span></a> The

conditioning by, and the acquiescence to the social-institutional imaginary is

such that our inner reality, our creative imagination, is co-opted: we cannot

easily imagine otherwise except in marginalized and pathologized forms. In

these forms, the creative imaginary is de-potentiated in terms of its

meaningful impact upon the dominant forms of the social imaginary. Therefore,

“what is essential to heteronomy... on the level of the individual, is the

domination of an...imaginary which has assumed the function of defining for the

subject both reality and desire.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn26' href="#_edn26"

name="_ednref26" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[26]<![endif]></span></a>

Although Castoriadis has a long history of addressing issues related to

ideology and totalitarianism, one can see that his analyses of heteronomy

address more subtle issues. Heteronomy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>is operative any time shared norms and values become automatic and

unquestioned, and have taken root in our inner beings in such a way as to

curtail imagining and thinking otherwise.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>I must emphasize that heteronomy is not just

a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>speculative</span></i>

problem for Castoriadis. He continually links heteronomy, and the concomitant

repression of alterity, directly to issues of oppression and, in an especially

powerful essay on the theme, to problems of racism. Specifically, Castoriadis

links racism with “an apparent incapacity to constitute oneself without

excluding the other,” which he argues “is coupled with an apparent inability to

exclude others without devaluing and, ultimately, hating them.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn27' href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[27]<![endif]></span></a>

He also describes this as “the exclusion of external alterity... .”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn28' href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[28]<![endif]></span></a>

While the causes of racism are obviously complex, at least part of the problem

connects with heteronomy on both of the levels analyzed by Castoriadis. It is

not only that participation in a heteronomously constituted social world can

involve cultivating exclusive attitudes toward “outsiders.” Additionally, the

inner mutilation occasioned by this participation, in which the socially

conditioned ego is but a fragment of the potentially autonomous personality

which has become dissociated from its own radical imaginary, leads to inner

conflict and self-hatred. As Castoriadis argues, “it is this hatred of the

self, usually intolerable under its overt form for obvious reasons, that

nourishes the most driven forms of the hatred of the other and is discharged in

its cruelest and most archaic manifestations.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn29'

href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[29]<![endif]></span></a> Here the

ethical aspects of heteronomy are most apparent. To say that the closed and

mutilated human beings produced within heteronomous social worlds “repress

alterity,” is also to say that they are inclined to project these repressed

features onto other human beings in a way that contributes to oppression and

violence.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>We may now see with greater clarity why, on

the level of internal dynamics, autonomy requires openness, differentiation,

and the fostering of inter-relations between conscious and unconscious (i.e.,

de-repression of the imagination). The development of this condition is

intrinsically connected with social institutions that enable and foster

questioning, rather than repressing reflection. “Autonomy is not Cartesian,

still less Sartrean freedom, the lightning stroke without density or

attachment... individual autonomy arises only under heavily instituted conditions.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn30' href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[30]<![endif]></span></a>

Thus, liberation of imaginary capacities to see otherwise is partially

dependent on social institutions that cultivate reflection. In this regard,

Castoriadis introduces the ancient Greek notion of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>paideia,</span></i> which expresses

pedagogy in the broad sense of acculturation, of cultivating the potential of

the human person across a spectrum of faculties.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn31'

href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[31]<![endif]></span></a> <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>Paideia</span></i>

connects the circuit between subjectivity and society, or, between the radical

and the social imaginary, that sustains autonomy and reflection.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Castoriadis’ arguments concerning the need

for social institutions fostering autonomy indicate an intermediary space that

is at once cultural and psychological. This is a space where representations

embodying shared values are shaped and re-shaped, and it is neither reducible

to wishes and fantasies, nor subject to strictly empirical criteria of

validation. Would it not be possible to understand religious formations, its

scriptures, symbols, and concepts as occupying such an interstitial position?

In this view, religion can be a dimension of creative and constituting

imaginary (or symbolic) constructions that allow humans to inhabit worlds of

meaning structured by ethical ideals, and which yet provide resources for

continued questioning and modification of those very same constructed worlds.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn32' href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[32]<![endif]></span></a>

Because reflection and autonomy are intrinsically connected with an ethical

dimension, addressing human interactions on inter-personal and inter-cultural

levels, Castoriadis’ analyses would seem to be highly relevant to religious

inquiry.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Having said this, it is clear that the

project of fostering social and individual autonomy faces strong resistance in

the tendency of all societies to maintain themselves as they are, which means

suppressing certain kinds of questioning. “Each society is a construction, a

constitution, a creation of a world... . Its own identity is nothing but this

‘system of interpretation’, the world it creates. And that is why (like every

individual) it perceives as a mortal threat any attack upon this system of

interpretation....”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn33' href="#_edn33"

Here we return explicitly to the problem of religion, which appears in many

places in Castoriadis’ writings, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>always as an example of a heteronomous social

institution and a related closed mode of subjectivity</span></i>. In an

important essay specifically on the topic of religion, Castoriadis links

religion to the “self-defense” of the instituted social imaginary. He argues

that the institution of society, in maintaining itself, “posits in effect, that

being is signification and that (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>social</span></i>) signification belongs to being.

Such is the meaning of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>religious</span></i> core of the institution of all

known societies... .”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn34' href="#_edn34"

name="_ednref34" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[34]<![endif]></span></a>

He further argues that “the enigma of heteronomous society and the enigma of

religion are, in very large part, one and the same enigma.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn35' href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[35]<![endif]></span></a> Thus,

religion becomes a name not for what is illusory or unprovable, as in

empiricist critiques, but for the tendency of imaginary institutions, which are

necessarily constitutive of social existence, to identify themselves with

ontological realities, thereby positing themselves as exterior and heteronomous

to human activity and reflection.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Castoriadis seems to be questioning <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>all </span></i>historical

religious formations; at the same time, he is using the term “religion” more

generally, to refer to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>tendencies to close imaginary worlds and to suppress

questioning and alterity</span></i>. For Castoriadis the issue is not simply

one of eliminating the vestiges of the historical religions in seemingly

advanced and secularized forms of society. Rather, as we have seen, heteronomy

persists, even in secular, democratic, technological societies, in the form of

the repression and “mutilation” of the radical imaginary. This closure of the

imagination seems to be Castoriadis’ main concern, to which the critique of

religion is attached as both a specific example and a general metaphor. When he

argues<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that “religion denies the

radical imaginary and puts in its place a particular imaginary creation,”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn36' href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[36]<![endif]></span></a>

this mirrors his more general comments concerning socially-constituted

heteronomy as imposing rigid, encompassing, pre-defined meaning systems upon

the personality.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>However, beyond generally associating

religion and heteronomy, Castoriadis develops more specific arguments about

religion that are quite revealing. He states that “what some have called the

need for religion corresponds to the refusal on the part of human beings to

recognize absolute alterity, the limit of all established signification... the

death dwelling within every life, the non-sense bordering on and penetrating

all sense.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn37' href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[37]<![endif]></span></a>

Interestingly, Castoriadis opposes trends evident in much postmodern religious

thought, and sees the religious as ultimately <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>denying</span></i> alterity, the

unthought beyond instituted signification. This is because, as he puts it,

“social imaginary significations have been in the main and in their essence

‘religious’: they have united recognition of the Abyss with its covering over.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn38' href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[38]<![endif]></span></a>

As soon as the Abyss–the unknown, the possible, the other perpetually lurking

beyond all finite and limited human imaginary constructions–becomes <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>named</span></i>,

and particularly when it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>named definitively and absolutely</span></i>, it is

no longer the Abyss, but has become domesticated and familiarized. Most

significant here is this very language of the Abyss as the unformed, open,

infinite nature of reality, and the question of its mode of engagement and

representation by human beings. This is inferred as that which is obscured by

instituted heteronomy; yet it is also what might shake and open heteronomous

structures by indicating an alterity always necessarily beyond full realization

and expression. For Castoriadis, however, the critical function of the always

other indicated by the Abyss is depotentiated by religious discourse. “The

Sacred is the reified and instituted simulacrum of the Abyss...,” that is, a

set of images and concepts that stand in for, and thereby repress, reflection

on the alterity which perpetually eludes full signification. Hence, Castoriadis

continues, “every religion is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>idolatry</span></i>–or is not socially effective

religion. In religion, words themselves–sacred words–function, and can only

function, as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:

italic'>idols</span></i>.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn39' href="#_edn39"

name="_ednref39" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[39]<![endif]></span></a>

Castoriadis assumes that all religion, all discourse on the sacred, is

literalized. He qualifies this by stating that it must be idolatrous <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>if it is to

be socially effective</span></i>, but in some ways this is the heart of the

matter for him; he is not interested in religion as something private, but only

insofar as it relates to social and institutional issues (indeed, isolating a

purely<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“private” sphere of religiosity

would be a somewhat illusory undertaking insofar as the private is always

affected by the social and cultural). Most importantly and, I think,

revealingly, in all of these passages Castoriadis <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>uses religious language and

concepts--the abyss, alterity, idolatry--against religion</span></i>.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>I do not wish to minimize the significance of

Castoriadis’ critique, which is as apposite and crucial today as at any point

in history, both in terms of a specific critique of religion in its dogmatic

institutionalized forms, and as a critique of all heteronomous tendencies

within societies. However, does not the use of religious language within a

critique of religion imply a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>split within religion</span></i>? Does it not

indicate another possible form of religion that recognizes the Abyss, does not

cover this over, hence does not “mutilate” the radical imagination? Clearly <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>iconoclasm</span></i>

is one such religious notion that provides an internal resistance to closure;

iconoclasm understood not as the abolition of all images, but as a principle of

de-literalizing and de-reifying closed culturally-established representations.

It seems highly significant that Castoriadis invokes this concept in attempting

to oppose the imaginary closure that generates heteronomy. This would seem to

question the adequacy of his sweeping critique of all religion, of everything

that might call itself religion. Resisting this comprehensive critique, while

yet maintaining focus on the problem of heteronomy, can open the way to a more

differentiated understanding of, or put more strongly, a splitting of religion.

I want to develop a line of thinking that does not retreat into a religiosity

that is merely a privatized and privileged space protected from the demands of

knowledge and the responsibilities of inter-personal societal existence. Rather,

I want to explore the question of how religion might be a tool for reflection

fostering autonomy precisely in Castoriadis’ terms.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>In light of the issue of splitting religion

that emerges from Castoriadis’ analyses, it is instructive to introduce certain

arguments from the work of Marcel Gauchet. Rather than simply locating religion

on the side of heteronomy over against autonomy, Gauchet explicitly tries to

establish a split <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:

italic'>within religion itself</span></i>. He articulates this splitting

specifically in terms of an historical analysis of the influence of the

monotheistic traditions of Judaism and Christianity upon the formation of the

modern Western world, but his arguments would seem to have broader implications

for understanding religion in its diverse manifestations.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>On the surface, Gauchet seems to have a more

positive view of contemporary Western society than does Castoriadis–for whom

heteronomy remains a problem related to the “mutilation of the radical

imaginary” despite apparent advances in secularization, individualization, and

democratization. Gauchet’s analysis begins by posing the question of the source

of what he calls “the Western world’s radical originality,” arguing that this

derives from a “restructuring [that] originated within religion [by which] it

escaped from and reversed its original religious orientation.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn40' href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[40]<![endif]></span></a>

Much like Castoriadis, Gauchet understands the “original” or “essential”

orientation of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:

italic'> all</span></i> religion as based on heteronomy and hierarchy. Of

course, he freely admits that he is engaging in speculation here. His aim is

not to formulate a detailed historical analysis, but to construct an “ideal

model” designed to clarify certain key characteristics of<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>contemporary Western society.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn41' href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[41]<![endif]></span></a>

For Gauchet, the two organizational modalities of heteronomy and hierarchy are

linked, insofar as hierarchy attempts to institute a direct mediation of the

conceived ontological order of things into the spheres of social, political,

and subjective organization. By contrast, the predominance of individualistic activity

in the attitudes and institutions of the modern West means that “our social

order differs so radically from previous ones by having successfully <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>reversed

heteronomy on every level.</span></i>”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn42'

href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[42]<![endif]></span></a> In this

regard, Gauchet posits two core orientations supported by human societies:

“either a bias in favor of the priority of the world and the law of things; or

one in favor of the priority of humans and their creative activity.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn43' href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[43]<![endif]></span></a>

Insofar as this parallels the distinction between heteronomy and autonomy,

Gauchet tends to see the modern West as embodying the latter in an

unprecedented way.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The first point to be made is that, granting <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>some</span></i>

advance in issues of freedom, democracy, and autonomy in modern Western

societies (which as we saw Castoriadis also proclaims), Gauchet sees these

accomplishments as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>both a turning away from religion and as fostered by

religion</span></i>. As noted, Gauchet begins by associating religion with

heteronomy, stating, for example, that “the religious is the principle of

mobility placed in the service of inertia, it is the principle of

transformation mobilized to protect the inviolability of things, it is the

power of negation wholly redirected toward accepting and renewing the

established law.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn44' href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[44]<![endif]></span></a>

His argument holds that religion is the means whereby humans deny and obscure

their own creative activity of constructing myths, symbols, laws, and values,

by attributing these to an external source, which he refers to as <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>self-negation</span></i>.

Significantly, he adds: “it is as if whatever caused man to be what he is was so

unbearable that he had no choice but to repress it immediately.”<a

This comment offers an important clue concerning the psychological tendencies

underpinning heteronomy.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>In contrast with this repression of human

world-building, Gauchet traces features of monotheistic religion, first in

Judaism and later in Christianity, which he sees as giving rise to the

inter-related tendencies of modern individualism, autonomy, critical

questioning, and world-altering activity (technology). Crucial to this argument

is an analysis of metaphysical and theological concepts and representations

that relates these seemingly “abstract” endeavors to the ways in which human

beings understand themselves, their relations with each other, and with the

world. Gauchet argues that, with the positing of an omnipotent divine being,

“the order of things is determined by the action of a single will, ...something

with which we can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:

italic'>communicate</span></i>, yet must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>deciphered</span></i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>interpreted</span></i>.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn46' href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[46]<![endif]></span></a>

Part of the argument here concerns the distancing of the divine principle from

intermediary explanatory forms, which leads not only to a sense of otherness

and enigma, but also to an active, interpretative orientation towards this

mystery. Another part of the argument concerns the need to reconcile the vicissitudes

of worldly life–such as unjust suffering and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>failure--with the activities of a benevolent, omnipotent deity. In the

monotheistic universe, Gauchet argues, “ethics became problematic. Whereas

previously ethics was basically positive, it now mainly tended to raise

questions.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn47' href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[47]<![endif]></span></a>

In this way, the “otherness” of God becomes connected with ethical questioning.

As Gauchet puts it “the paradox is that an increase in a figurative or

experienced otherness corresponds to a decrease in an actually implemented otherness;

strengthening the image of the Other involves an actual decline in dependence

on it.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn48' href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[48]<![endif]></span></a>

As representations of what is considered to be divine become <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>distanced

from and other to </span></i>any immediate, instituted,<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>hierarchically-structured ordering of the

experienced world, a space opens for human reflection. In this regard, Gauchet

argues that the postulation of a “God who is other” provided the “metaphysical

grounds for the possible dissolution of the hierarchical principle... .”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn49' href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[49]<![endif]></span></a>

As with Castoriadis, this making-other may also be understood in relation to

the related notions of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>the Abyss and iconoclasm</span></i>. The latter

provides a principle recognizing that no interpretation or representation can

ever be total or final in structuring human social existence along lines of

meaning, purpose, and value. This recognition can serve to precipitate ongoing

reflective questioning ameliorating existing structures. Therefore, Gauchet

speaks of “transcendence understood as a dynamic process with an in-built

capacity to unfold beyond its rigid doctrinal formulation.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn50' href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[50]<![endif]></span></a> This is

where a splitting internal to the life of religious reflection can be

discerned.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Metaphysics, in postulating a principle of

irreducible alterity, can be said to deconstruct itself in its mode of positing

closed and hierarchically organized systems. The Other can never be fully

absorbed into representational forms, engendering a necessary remainder

relativizing the claims of those forms and the structures they support to be

complete or fully adequate. This splitting, in which, “personal mediation

turned against institutional mediation,”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn51'

href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[51]<![endif]></span></a> generates an

ongoing process of questioning and potential transformation. The tension on the

metaphysical or theological level of doctrine, that is, in the religious

imaginary, fosters a splitting between: a) autonomous reflection undertaken by

individuals and communities who, as it were, instaurate religious alterity and

iconoclasm in their pursuit of truth and meaning beyond any totalized

formation, and b) the heteronomous, institutionalized forms of the religious

imaginary which maintain a hierarchical world by claiming to mediate directly

“truth” on an absolute level. Gauchet goes one step further in his analysis. He

notes that a tension is maintained between “God’s otherness,” or the principle

of alterity, and the “legitimation of the terrestrial sphere” symbolized in the

Christian doctrine of the Incarnation. This tension engenders an active and

open-ended relation toward reality. Thus, “the stage was set for a development

totally opposed to any known religious tradition, namely, the combination of

God’s deepening call [i.e., the conceptualization of otherness relativizing

things as they are] with a simultaneous deepening interest in the world.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn52' href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[52]<![endif]></span></a>

The final link in Gauchet’s argument is that, in conjoining a call to

transcendence with a focus on immanence,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>reflective subjectivity becomes active, world-transforming

subjectivity–a key attribute of modern, secularized, technological societies.

(Here Gauchet acknowledges his debt to Max Weber’s analysis of the inner

worldly asceticism evident in Protestant Christianity, but he sees this as one

element in a much more sweeping process.)<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn53'

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Gauchet’s divergence from Castoriadis on the

issue of religion’s contribution to modernity is associated with a quite

different evaluation of the impact of ancient Greece. For example, Gauchet

argues that “Christian speculation ...allow[ed] the world to be grasped as an

object, and ... human actors to set themselves up as cognitive subjects radically

detached from the world-as-object. All this was totally foreign to Greek

reason, which was organized by the primacy of the all-inclusive One.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn54' href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[54]<![endif]></span></a>

Further connecting the speculative and social-political realms, Gauchet adds

that the “limits of Greek thought compared to modern thought correspond

precisely with the limits of Greek democracy, compared to modern political

individualism.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn55' href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55"

title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[55]<![endif]></span></a>

Gauchet’s evaluation of ancient Greece’s relation to modern democratic

individualism is at least partially conditioned by his overall concern to

illustrate the unique contributions of the Jewish and Christian traditions. He

has, however, been criticized on this point. For example, Pierre Manent argues

that Gauchet inadequately evaluates the Greek contribution to modern democracy.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn56' href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[56]<![endif]></span></a>

However, other contemporary theorists support Gauchet in arguing for the

profound influence of the Biblical tradition on the rise of Western democracy,

and for shaping notions of individual rights and freedoms, while qualifying

this by also noting the significance of Classical sources. Blandine Kriegel, in

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>The State

and the Rule of Law</span></i>, points out that modern notions of law draw from

three sources: “Greek natural law, Roman civil law, and Jewish moral law.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn57' href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[57]<![endif]></span></a>

Most importantly for our concerns, she specifically argues that one of the

conditions for a doctrine of human rights is that “human beings must be

recognized as having value,” and she emphasizes that this “idea of the human

being is biblical” rather than Greek.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn58'

href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[58]<![endif]></span></a> Of course,

Kriegel also raises the question of whether the use of scripture, which was

pervasive in the writings of the early moderns, constitutes “an intrusion of

religion into politics.” Her answer is: “Yes and no. In the absence of a

juridical model, the use made of scripture was finely tuned to grant entry only

to its moral teachings and to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>filter out its institutional structure</span></i>.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn59' href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[59]<![endif]></span></a>

In Kriegel’s analysis, the Biblical tradition has provided resources

contributing to the rise of autonomy and democracy, and these resources can be

separated, both conceptually and in their historical influence, from

institutional forms that take on a heteronomous aspect.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Kriegel’s comments concerning separation of

the moral from the institutional in the modern liberal appropriation of

religious ideas and values augment our understanding of the two sides to

religion formulated by Gauchet. He refers to this as “an irreversible split

between two tendencies reflecting dogma’s inner tensions: on the one hand,

there is a tendency to continually reinvent God’s difference; and opposed to

this, an unshakable conservative tendency to safeguard a living bond between

heaven and earth.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn60' href="#_edn60"

name="_ednref60" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[60]<![endif]></span></a>

Now, it is this latter tendency, understandable as it may be, that confirms

Castoriadis’ association of “religion” with heteronomous orientations that

idolatrously cover over alterity and the Abyss. Gauchet’s contribution is to

provide tools for a critical distinction that locates heteronomy as one pole

within a dynamic tension internal to religion(s). This allows us to draw upon

the potentially transformative resources of religious reflection and

imagination in the face of the crises of meaning and ethical orientation

associated with the ever-evolving global-market instrumental-technological

mass-media culture of the present. At the same time, Gauchet’s awareness of

problematic heteronomous tendencies in religion, and his maintenance of a

critical splitting, remain essential in order to avoid the retrogressive

bypassing of the Enlightenment emphasis on differentiated autonomous reflection

that characterizes many contemporary calls for a return to religious values.</span><p></li>

proliferation or self-centered individualism, not also subject to problems of a

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>In fact, towards the end of his analysis

Gauchet raises a number of issues which parallel and supplement Castoriadis’

arguments. For example, Gauchet discusses the displacement from transcendent to

immanent structures that “gives rise to a new category of sacred beings,

abstract individuals, collective apparitions, that we belong to and which crush

us, immanent deities which, though never seen, continue to receive our

devotion: the invisible State and the everlasting Nation.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn61' href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

evolve historically, these institutions are no longer understood as literally

deriving from an extra-human source. Yet, despite increasing recognition of

their humanly constructed origins, social institutions (the instituted

imaginary) retain an independence from human reflection and action, as well as

an opacity that makes it difficult to attain awareness of how they influence

us, and how they might be changed. Thus Gauchet speaks of “the imperatives that

condition and regulate our actions” and notes that “these imperatives have not

become clearer by ceasing to be externally imposed.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn62' href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

the point later in the text, arguing that “bringing the social foundation back

not mean putting it directly in their possession.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Gauchet seems less concerned with the

lingering role of institutionalized religions in the contemporary world than

with the after-effects and new tasks arising from the transition to “secular”

modernity. He allows, of course, that religions in their traditional forms

still exert a powerful influence on the lives of many individuals and

sub-groups, but argues that this has become disconnected from predominant

social attitudes and mores.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn65' href="#_edn65"

name="_ednref65" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[65]<![endif]></span></a>

If we grant some general accuracy to this analysis, the issues Gauchet opens up

concern the intransigent quality of conditioning forces in societies which are

no longer heteronomous in the obvious sense, and the question of possible

resources for reflection and for furthering autonomy. Where Gauchet differs from

Castoriadis, and here he consistently follows through on the splitting of

religion he has articulated, is in understanding issues of reflective ethical

subjectivity as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:

italic'>transmuted versions of religious problems</span></i>, once

transcendence has been liberated from models emphasizing hierarchy and stasis.

Therefore, the “splitting” he has traced as a historical process is not

something completed once and for all, but constitutes an ongoing task of

reflection.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>One area where the issue of subjectivity

arises as an ethical problem is in relation to entrenched Western notions of

individualism. Both Gauchet and Castoriadis see atomized individualism as a

modality of subjectivity distinct from reflective autonomy. We saw this in

Castoriadis’ differentiation between autonomy and the closed “autopoiesis” of

Varela. Elsewhere, Castoriadis emphasizes that, insofar as autonomy is

correlated with democracy “it can only be, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-style:italic'>de facto</span></i> as well as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>de jure</span></i>, self-limitation.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn66' href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[66]<![endif]></span></a>

Likewise, for Gauchet the development of modern individualism becomes warped

insofar as it tends to deny sociability.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn67'

href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[67]<![endif]></span></a> This is a

problem because individualism represses the inter-dependency of self and other,

represses alterity, and thus, as we saw in Castoriadis’ arguments, actually

instates a form of closure. Here, I want simply to point out how religious

issues of meaning and ethics reappear in connection with the task of fostering

autonomy in a way that acknowledges the need for self-limitation in relation to

others. A fine analysis of these issues has been formulated by Alain Renaut,

who differentiates between “humanism (understood as the valorization of

autonomy) and individualism (as the valorization of independence).”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn68' href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[68]<![endif]></span></a>

For Renaut, the key to this distinction is that autonomy accepts, and indeed

requires, laws, norms, and limits on independence in order to foster ethical

inter-connections between subjects.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn69'

href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[69]<![endif]></span></a> This

argument augments Gauchet’s sense of how problems related to religion become

transmuted into an ethics based on inner-worldly relations with the other.

Renaut, following this line of thought, points to the seminal inter-connections

between religion, ethics and “thinking of subjectivity as transcendence, and of

transcendence as communication” with reference to the work of Emmanuel Levinas.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn70' href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[70]<![endif]></span></a>

In relation to issues of autonomy, all of these thinkers emphasize that

openness to a pluralized alterity, rather than either monadological

individualism or conformity within heteronomous mass structures, is required to

reflect on and transform the closed formations of culturally constituted

subjects.</span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>What kind of a version of “religion” emerges

from all of this? The question concerns the status of historically and

culturally constituted representations informing our values and ethical

orientations, and how we relate to them. With regard to this issue, Luc Ferry

speaks of the need to approach religious and metaphysical categories in what he

terms a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>de-fetishized</span></i>

manner. “Fetishizing” (a term common to both Marxist and Freudian discourse),

is used by Ferry in more ideologically neutral terms to describe a process

whereby the mental activity leading to an idea or concept is obscured, so that

the concept is treated as an object disconnected from its constituting history.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn71' href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[71]<![endif]></span></a>

By contrast, de-fetishization allows religious categories to act as “principles

of reflection” by which we critically engage ethical issues on the

interpersonal and social levels.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn72' href="#_edn72"

name="_ednref72" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[72]<![endif]></span></a>

This is precisely the antithesis of the “total explanation” critiqued by

Castoriadis, because it is characterized by reflective guidelines that are

altered as they are applied in new situations. Similarly, Peter Dews states

with regard to de-literalized metaphysics, that it “does not search for

bedrock, but rather helps to hold open those fragile horizons of significance

which lie <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>beyond</span></i>

the dispersed and compartmentalized forms of modern inquiry.”<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn73' href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[73]<![endif]></span></a></span><p></li>

  <li>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Thus, one might understand religious

discourse not as pointing to an unquestioned order which institutes heteronomy,

but as pointing ahead, to possibility. In this form, religion serves as a

social vehicle for the imaginary “doubling” Castoriadis speaks of as necessary

for ethical reflection. That is, religion offers a set of images, symbols,

principles and values that always maintain a sense of what is <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>other than</span></i>

any existing social forms. It thereby provides a critical reference for

augmenting those forms in terms of their adequacy in instituting principles

such as freedom, justice, equality, and compassion. Here, religion becomes a

discourse of alterity and of the Abyss, guided by the principle of iconoclasm.

It does not offer fixed transcendentals or ideals instated within closed

hierarchical systems, but rather presents heuristic principles that both

question, from an ethical standpoint, extant forms of the social imaginary, and

also offer regulative and imaginative guidance to the future-oriented project

of autonomous subjectivity-in-society.</span><p></li>

See Ibid, p.148. The reference to Levinas is germane to the issue of founding

ethics and religion upon inter-human relations. However, it also raises a

number of potentially fascinating debates. For example, how might Levinas’

declaration of an “ethics of heteronomy” stand in relation to the pointed

critiques of heteronomy of both Castoriadis and Gauchet? While this issue

cannot be properly addressed here, suffice it to say that all three thinkers

share a model of ethical subjectivity that requires interconnectedness with

others.</p>

  <p class="footer"><b>James J. DiCenso</b> received his Ph.D. in Religion from Syracuse University

  in 1987, and has taught there, at Oberlin College, at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and is currently Associate Professor of

  Religion at the University of Toronto. DiCenso specializes in modern and

  contemporary thought, especially in the psychoanalytic and Continental philosophy traditions, and its application to religious issues.

  DiCenso's work has been consistent in exploring the possibilities of re-interpreting religion as related to current concerns with ethics,

  meaning and orientation on the personal and cultural levels. He is the author of two books:

  <i> Hermeneutics and the Disclosure of Truth: A Study in the Work of Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur</i> (University of Virginia

  Press, 1990), and <i> The Other Freud: Religion, Culture and Psychoanalysis</i>

  (Routledge, 1999). He has also published numerous articles on the intersections between religion and philosophy  in Derrida, Lacan,

  Kristeva, and others. He is currently working on a third book analyzing religion in relation to ethical and socio-political issues, focussing on

  resources for actualizing justice, freedom, and human rights.</p>
