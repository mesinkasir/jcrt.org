<IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/I.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="I" ALIGN="LEFT"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>
spent yesterday searching for where to start this article. Although
I’d gone to the computer inspired, the rhythm failed and the words sounded
false and forced. I countered this dispirited feeling with a renewed
determination to find ‘the right starting point’, believing, crazily, that I
couldn’t begin writing without it. As the discarded sentences continued to
pile, however, I began taking their failure personally, splitting my attention
between the problem of the starting point and the larger problem of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>me</span></i>:
why couldn’t I find where to start? My concern had initially been the intuition
buzzing in my gut but now it shifted to a concern with the place where I should
have been, and with this shift my failings and problems began multiplying, like
the brooms in <i><span style='font-style:
italic'>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</span></i>. I could no longer hold a thought
steadily. I was everywhere else, with nothing to hold me, no feeling of depth
or resonance or belonging. My breathing was fast and shallow, as if I hadn’t
time to breathe, as if I didn’t want the air inside me, as if it didn’t belong
to me. <o:p></o:p></span><P>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Soon it was too much for me, a catastrophe. The elusive starting place
was now only a symptom of the <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>everything wrong</span></i> in which I was drowning.
I had to be saved because I could no longer imagine saving myself. If only my
family and friends needed less of my time, if only I had more study leave, if
only I didn’t have to stop to do the shopping, if only universities were better
managed: if only these reasonable conditions were met, the article would be
written and I would be all right. Being ‘all right’ is the fantasy, derived
from the logic of stories, that if we discover the secret distant place, if we
succeed in our quest, then some ever after peace will follow. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Still another level of panic was reached when the catastrophe itself
became cause for a search for blame and remedy. If only I was better or calmer
or more intelligent …. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Self-blame and the blaming of others were alternating currents. I was a
victim of others’ control or a victim of my own failure of control: whether
here or there, control was <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>somewhere</span></i>, and, wherever it was, if the
writing, if life, if the world was wrong, then someone or something was to
blame and the problem should be fixed! But the words stayed ugly. And,
throughout the day, I was ugly too, short-tempered and self-righteous and ungenerous
with those I love. I couldn’t feel the <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>life</span></i> of my love for them. I couldn’t look
directly at them. I was sulking behind the windows of my eyes. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>This panic, which felt so out of control, was the result of my
determination to exercise control. I couldn’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>find</span></i> where to start or how
to write, and the harder I looked, the more alienated I became from where I was
<i><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i>
from what I wanted. But, then again, I couldn’t find what I wanted because it
wasn’t lost: the place to start was always right in front of me. Where else
could it have been? <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Whether I’m writing, cooking, gardening or considering a problem, my
responsibility is not to fix the text, the food or the garden, but to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>be</span></i>
with them, listen to them, respond to them spontaneously. As Annie Dillard
says, ‘I do not so much write a book as sit up with it…. I enter its room with
dread and sympathy for its many disorders. I hold its hand and hope it will get
better’ (1989: 52). The remedy is neither up to me nor the other: creativity
occurs <i><span style='font-style:italic'>between</span></i>,
but it only occurs if I trust the essential goodness of the other. And
yesterday I couldn’t feel the life in my text, any more than I could feel the
life in my love for my loved ones. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The change that allowed me to write occurred in the late afternoon, not
through discovery of a missing first word, not through any act of mine, but
through a change in my relations with the world. I happened to look out the
window and the sight that had been mute and uninspired, that I’d not been able
to <i><span style='font-style:italic'>see</span></i>,
because I’d been elsewhere, this sight now held my gaze for a vital moment with
its loveliness. I was surprised by the softness of the hills in the tender
light before sunset; with the dew falling over them with utter gentleness, they
looked vulnerable, peaceful, ready for sleep. I’m sure I was reminded of the
sight of my sleeping children, a vision that never fails to carry me away, back
to the world. But, then again, perhaps my sleeping children remind me of these
eternal hills.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Because I could feel this tenderness in the hills, I could feel
gentleness and compassion in me, and, with soft eyes, I saw my part in the
world rather than my masterly oversight of it. In that moment of love, I took
my first real breath for the day, except that it wasn’t clear it was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>me</span></i>
breathing. Inspiration, as the word suggests, is a form of breathing, passive <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i>
active, accessing knowledge located inside <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i> outside me: <o:p></o:p></span>

<P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>In this experience of interbreathing, there is a different sense of
being ‘all right’: a sense of the eternal rather than the ever after. I would
be all right not because I’d achieve some goal but because I was where I
belonged, and always would belong, whatever I did. My restraints and choices --
what was given and what was needed -- matched as eternally as the child’s weary
head fits the nest of the parent’s shoulder and neck, as my footsteps match the
stone paths that wind around these hills. There was no judgement in the hills
or the falling dew, just as there is no judgement in grace. And I could feel
that the text deserved trust. I could feel its heart when I could feel mine. Writers,
readers and texts can only work on each other, address each other, if they are
in love. Otherwise, they are ‘automatically at the wrong distance’ (Cixous,
1988: 147). Creative blocks come from having expectations that take me away
from where I am, and what is passing through me, at a particular moment
(McNiff, 1995: 117).<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

make life so hard? During my writer’s block, was my panic and frustrated anger
a result of my hubris as Author? Do I sulkily refuse what’s offered because my
self can’t accept that it isn’t independent, that it cannot control its fate,
that I may do things without doing them <i><span

to find what’s already been provided? <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

</blockquote>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The surprise of the hills filled my world, replacing the nothing that
isn’t there with the nothing that is. Weighed down with my failings and
misfortunes, I’d wanted to be elsewhere, but now I overflowed with gratitude
for the glory of the world as it was. Here I was! Here we were! The dew fell
upon us, like a blessing of heaven, reminding me that the world I’d taken as
given was, truly,<i><span style='font-style:
italic'> given</span></i>. Because I could never explain the gift, even if
scientists eventually think they know <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>what</span></i> we’ve been given, I knew mystery,
with absolute certainty. And so although a moment before I’d felt sick, picking
and shuffling and unpicking my arbitrary thoughts and sentences, the
gratuitousness of the world now made it both meaningful and inexplicable. My
sentences were no longer <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>about</span></i> but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>of </span></i>the world. I wrote to
find new ways to say Hallelujah!<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>A parent sees this wondrous gratuity in the
downy light they can never touch on the child’s skin. They embrace their
children desperately because they know, from the moment of the child's birth,
that the child is a gift, an inexplicable blessing that intrudes in their lives
and possesses their hearts, but is always going to be other, always beyond
them, always liable to leave. If the constantly renewed surprise of the downy
skin ensures the gift isn’t taken for granted, this vital sense of gratitude
and mystery becomes the source of bliss, wonder, inspiration and learning.
Gratitude for the child’s grace allows parents to relearn what is important,
how to live and die, how to see and smell and touch and taste and hear as if it
matters. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>When the hills reached out to me, I realised, in my return to the
warmth of life, that I must have been dead when I took life for granted. This
inspiring sight of the hills was as fresh as the moment of genesis. The world
and I were <i><span style='font-style:italic'>vitally</span></i>
alive. This miracle of life in the middle of the endlessness of the universe is
absurd unless gratefully received, yet many of us take gifts themselves for
granted. Insisting that gifts are never <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>present</span></i>, because they oblige future
repayment in the form of gratitude or return gift, cynics say that gifts are no
more than a prettily-decorated form of economic investment. But the dewy light
sought nothing from me, and had I purposefully looked to the hills for
inspiration it would not have come. Rather than debt, it is joy and celebration
that requires gifts and gratitude. Gratitude is itself gratuitous, for thanks
must be <i><span style='font-style:italic'>given</span></i>.
Likewise, gratuities are grateful, if only for the opportunity for generosity
that they give to the giver. Obligatory gifts and gratitude, then, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>aren’t</span></i>
gifts and gratitude. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>By changing what I take for granted, bringing more of the world alive
by calling my surprised attention to things to which I’d been dead, gratitude
is an inherently creative condition. My life changes whenever I gratefully
accept the world’s gifts. But these changes in turn bring something new to the
world, something that is not simply mine but is nonetheless unique because of
whatever special qualities I bring into play. My gratitude is at once a
receiving <i><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i>
giving, just as my creativity is at once taken from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i> given to the world. This
interchange is as easy, graceful and free as breathing, without any balance
sheet mediating the moments, and without a distinct consciousness to play
accountant. Characterising breath as the inspirational gift of life, David
Steindl-Rast puts it aptly:<o:p></o:p></span>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>‘And’ is the decisive word in give-and-take. Mere
giving is as lifeless as mere taking. If you merely take a breath and stop
there, you are dead. And when you merely breathe out and stop there, you are
also dead. Life is not giving <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>or</span></i> taking, but give-<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i>-take. Breathing is an
obvious example, but the same give-and-take can be found wherever there is
life. It is the dynamic expression of universal belonging. (1984: 199)<o:p></o:p></span>
</blockquote>
<P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Just as attention to breath can make me feel
that I am all breathing, attention to grace and gratitude makes me aware that
I’m not distinct giver or receiver but the very manifestation of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘and’, the gift and celebration in-between.
Life itself seems joyful praise, both gift and gratitude, and I am at once
singer, listener, song and singing. In this, of course, I approach the
condition of angels. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>I imagine that when Bach wrote music as an offering to the glory of
God, he was carried toward glory by his sense of gratitude for the gratitude
that gave him his compositional gift of accepting the gift of God that produced
the work. This ecstatic spiralling logic of the ‘and’ is the nature of divine
music. It is also the nature of love and love-making, for who gives and takes
in love-making? Who is active and who is passive? Whose body, breath and voice
is whose?<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Taking the form of praiseful thanksgiving,
creativity and love no longer seem a manifestations of ego or acts of
self-expression. Through creativity we find our central Godlikeness, but in a
humble rather than Oedipal or Promethean way, through our nothingness. Praising
and thanking God, saying Yes to the God’s gift of life, we cannot help
(re)creating the world, and in doing so we are doing God’s work and imitating
God’s own gift of creativity. The empty receptivity of gratefulness is itself a
form of overflowing fullness. As Hildegard of Bingen says, and Wim Wenders’
film <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Wings
of Desire</span></i> shows, this fleshy creativity amazes angels, ‘[f]or the
angel without the work of the flesh is simply praise; but the humans with their
corporeal works are a glorification: therefore the angels praise humans’ work’
(Hildegard of Bingen, quoted in Fox and Sheldrake, 1996: 165).</span><P></LI>

    <p style="margin-right: 0"><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Sceptics might say this argument focuses on joy and overlooks sorrow,
but these aren’t opposing terms. My joy in my friends and family, for example,
is inseparable from the anguish of my knowledge that I will lose them at some
time. Because it reminds us of our blessings, sorrow is itself a blessing, and
anyone who turns from sorrow slips into a half-life, the fear of being really
alive leading them to take the world for granted. As long as we attend to it,
everything the world offers is a gift that awakens us to life. Once I could
attend to it, for example, my writer’s block gave me the right place to start

children’s stories, the world directly addresses the person filled with wonder.
Wherever I attend - the hills outside, casual phrases, my children’s books,
movies, songs - the world is alive to my concerns. Everyday events that
normally pass unnoticed, half-lived, become auspicious; apparently separate
phenomena reveal their profound connections. When the world <i

presence of a (new) birth that is also our (original) birth. We chase some
inkling of new understanding, before finally recognising, with great surprise
and satisfaction, that we’re back where we were (not) when we started. Wonder
brings a sense that only now that our ‘origin’ has shifted do we feel at home
there. We’re where we were but seeing it afresh.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Consider wonder’s characteristic double take.
We see something, and then we stop and <i><span

second take as an elastic movement of head and eyes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>toward</span></i> the newly seen
object, which has suddenly come alive for us. Yet we also say we’re ‘taken
aback’ by the shock of the new, that it ‘sets us back on our heels’. So the
double take actually involves three moments - it draws me extraordinarily close
to the other by estranging me from, by reminding me of, my ordinary senses of
identity and the world. It suspends me in-between, evoking a sense of time that
is here <i><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i>
there but is not chronological, is not here <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>or</span></i> there (see Irigaray, 1993: 73-4). <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The doubled and suspended qualities of wonder
partly explain why it calls out metaphors of vibration. Shuddering, buzzing,
fluttering, shivering, shimmering: such terms insist on movement <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i>
stability. These terms also highlight wonder’s suspenseful fragility. It is a
way of knowing that evades the arrested qualities required for apprehension; it
cannot be conveyed to another or stored for oneself; it is defenceless in the
face of blasé trivialisation; its particular momentary qualities are not
directly expressed in the cultural forms that emerge from it. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Perhaps most of all, however, the trembling
indicates the dreadful edge of wonder. Sometimes, in the ecstasy of wonder, I
think I’ll explode with all the intuitions calling for utterance. Like the
figures in Biblical paintings who shelter from God’s radiance behind their
outstretched hands, I fear I can’t take any more. Wonder is beautiful, and
beauty, Rainer Maria Rilke said, ‘is but the beginning of terror which we can
just barely sustain, and we admire it so, because it serenely disdains to
destroy us’ (quoted in Steindl-Rast, 1998: 12).<span style="mso-spacerun:

Angel for Vigils wears a dark scarlet garment and holds his horn as if he were

that signals, ‘Wait; not yet.’ His eyes are turned upward. He waits in that
reverent silence out of which every genuine sound must come. This angel

  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>So, wonder is where knowing and creativity
begin. But although the word ‘wonder’ is often used in everyday life, we
normally take for granted the connection between this everyday process and the
grander forms of wonder. What’s involved when I wonder which road to take, or
what type of tree to plant, or when to intervene in a heated tutorial
discussion, or how to draw the skeleton-knight that my son has requested? <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Let’s imagine that the thought ‘I’m hungry’
has popped into my consciousness. Wondering what to eat, I look at the
ingredients in my refrigerator. If I’m speeding through my day, all over the
place, nothing in the fridge will hold my attention and I’ll quickly move,
dissatisfied, to the kitchen cupboard. But if I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>see</span></i> something in the
refrigerator, clock-time pauses, and my eyes glaze slightly while I look,
wonderingly, at the space <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>between</span></i> the ingredients I’ve noticed. This
is a space that I can never get a grip on, but which I can feel, and palpate.
It is space of thick rather than thin air. And it is located both outside me,
in my refrigerator, and in my belly. Inside and outside mimic each other,
without allowing me to settle which is the original and which the copy. From
this indeterminate but tangible space, from the belly of the refrigerator, I’m
given an intuition about what to do with these ingredients. I do not will this
intuition, but wait for it to occur or come to me. It might take the form of an
image or a taste or a smell or a memory of another meal and another occasion.
But the intuition isn’t set down: it isn’t a recipe, even if it leads me to a
recipe, and it isn’t, strictly speaking, an origin. It’s a feeling that I must
be open to, and trust, and follow. It’s a form of knowing that cannot express
what it knows, either to me or to others. Yet feeling the wonderful
possibilities of these ingredients in my belly, and holding this feeling
attentively, I can move toward a meal that gives form to the feeling without
being a simple transcription of it. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>According to the theologian Stephen Crites,
the same process of wonder is involved every time we wonder how to tell a
story, even if it’s only the evening-time story of our day. Crites addresses
this issue by distinguishing sacred and mundane stories. The former, which are often
called archetypes, live in ‘the arms and legs and bellies of the celebrants’
(1989: 69). They cannot be directly told because they are less objects of
consciousness than the stuff from which consciousness is formed. Sometimes,
though, in moments of clarity, we <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>awaken to</span></i> these stories, and our mundane
stories, those that can be directly seen, heard and devised, are attempts to
articulate these awakenings. Mundane stories are only effective because they
remind audiences of the sacred stories that cannot be uttered directly, but
mundane stories never exhaust the sacred, even if there are epiphanic moments
when, as listeners and writers and readers, we feel the gap closed. <o:p></o:p></span><b

  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The philosophers Maurice Merleau-Ponty and
Cornelius Castoriadis talk in similar terms of a gap between what is sayable
and what is unsayable. Whether the speaker is the Archangel Gabriel or the
person beside you on the bus, the desire to speak comes from<o:p></o:p></span>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>a void which swells in the already said; a void
which is determined in the sense that the one who is about to speak knows that
there is something other and more to be said than what has already been said,
but nothing positive beyond that fact, beyond the fact that it is not said by
what has already been said. (Castoriadis, 1984: 132)<o:p></o:p></span>
</blockquote><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>This void involves the familiar paradox of
empty and full. An absence or lack, the void nonetheless swells as a presence.
Indeed, it is so <i><span style='font-style:
italic'>positive</span></i> that what’s been said pales into negativity: the
presence -- the said -- comes to feel like an absence, while the void that
cannot be said becomes overwhelmingly present. What matters is the thing that
cannot be said, cannot be captured, but can so powerfully be felt. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Castoriadis highlights the parallel between
unsayable and ground when he comments that the sayable ‘leans’ on the
unsayable: words and other signs rest on ‘horizons of imaginary significance’
which can be discussed but never exhausted or expressed. The phenomenon of the
horizon evokes what some call God, emptiness or nothingness, and others call
transitional space, the in-between or prepositional. As Castoriadis says, these
imaginary horizons of sociality ‘<i><span
style='font-style:italic'>denote</span></i> nothing at all, and they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>connote</span></i>
just about everything’ (Castoriadis, 1987: 143). ‘Nothing at all’ and
‘everything’ turn on each other like emptiness and fullness.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Every time I speak, then, my words lean on
the wonderful for which I have no words: I make an utterance without knowing
exactly what I’m saying, then respond to it as my own audience, test it against
the knowledge of my arms and legs and especially belly, feel a deficiency or
void here or a discordance there, take another stab at the utterance, respond
to this amendment - and so it goes, until time elapses or my body rests. Often
I cannot find a word to fill the void, and the wonderful is lost, until
apparently recalled by reading someone else’s writing. Even when a word fits
perfectly, it isn’t because it repeats a pre&#8209;existing form. In Roger
Caillois’ haunting phrase, it ‘is similar, not similar to something, just <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>similar</span></i>’
(1984: 30). The wonderful, the imaginary, sacred or archetypal, is
prepositional. It is palpable but cannot be grasped. It is nothing.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Despite being taken for granted, this strange
process of wondering underlies most of the phenomena I describe as <i

decisions and activities. When I feel that I’m <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>really cooking</span></i>, the origin
isn’t me but a sensitivity toward the world’s wonder. Making music from the
sound of silence, the angel of vigil depicts the conception and creation of
works of art, but is also a reminder of the most everyday miracles of life. The
angel shows why thanks should be given for the humblest meal, but also shows
why good cooking is necessarily grateful, why every meal is a sacrament.<o:p></o:p></span><span

the moment of the Annunciation, Fra Angelico gives his angel wings that are
banded in rainbow colours.... A man can only guess at the reality of a woman's
conception, via the imperfect analog of what happens with language: when an
author thinks that he has something to say, before speaking or writing, his
body, as if filled with love, becomes uplifted and vibrates like a rainbow. He
doesn’t yet know where his idea will settle, or in which direction it will go,
or in what shades it will be coloured. The bodily state which precedes the
emergence of an idea in spoken form begins in an aurora borealis, a kind of
totality shaped liked an opened-out fan, accompanied by such an emotion that
the body experiences the word ‘emotion’ itself as that movement of soaring
flight, enraptured and suspended, to which it refers. Hence these wings which
beat like those of a bird fluttering over a fixed point without yet having
decided on a direction, and which are shaded in every possible colour, of
which, at the end, only one will remain. That is what intuition sees before the
thing actually comes into sight. (Serres, 1995: 109; original ellipsis)</span><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span>

Gabriel. The opportunity to speak - the empty plate, the pregnant silence, the
white page, the blank canvas - is itself inspiring, both empty and full, as

breathing <i><span style='font-style:italic'>in</span></i>
the other (inspiring). Inside and outside, activity and passivity, inspiration
and expiration: inspiration overflows such categorical boundaries. As would-be
annunciator, I become a <i><span

flesh; I cannot say if I possess or am possessed by the thought which buzzes
and grows inside me, demanding birth; I cannot say if I approached the world or

  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Fra Angelico’s Gabriel and Mary are separate,
not touching, their hands holding themselves in. Mary’s conception and
pregnancy is as far from Gabriel’s direct understanding as Gabriel’s angelic
purpose is from Mary’s; neither can conceive (of) the other's conception, but
each, on either side of their meeting, signifies to the other their own
mysterious condition. Mary’s child and Gabriel’s words: both are alloyed
mysteries to those about to issue them, and both will remain wonders of
alterity once produced. So Mary and Gabriel are separate, but they respectfully
gesture toward each other. The possibility of a bond between them, what they
recognise in each other, is the divine. The speaker who produces words and the mother
who produces a child: these are irreparably different processes, but deeply
intertwined through metaphor and archetype. In this moment of annunciation,
where the conventional is-ness of things is called into question by their
relationality and always emergent quality, Mary cannot settle on the form of
salutary words to offer her visitor.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Orthodox causality is disrupted in this
creative process: on his Master’s instructions, Gabriel announces the imminent
birth of the Lord, his Master; Mary receives a message from the Lord who will
be her issue. To put this another way, at the moment before my annunciation,
before I cook or write, I forgo the masterly univocality of announcement and
enter the flow of a relation with the world around me. This enchanted moment of
conception suspends inside and outside, and <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>performs</span></i> the religious experience of
communion that Fra Angelico’s Gabriel may have also represented. As Serres
(1995: 25) comments, ‘When angels breathe out, by so doing they reveal their
message twice: what they produce, and what they are.’<o:p></o:p><![endif]><o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

description or expression but rather the conception and rebirth of the world,
the reenactment of creation. This is the word becoming flesh: the word ‘occurs’
to me, it ‘strikes’ me. It is also flesh becoming word, allowing me to write
the world through my body. The divine is not here or there but is the flow between,
the shiver of resonance, effervescence, communion, inspiration. It is the <i

  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>This conception takes place not in
chronological time but in eternity, which is to time what nothing is to things.
Just as every thing leans on nothing, every beginning leans on eternity, as
Mircea Eliade (1971) suggests in his account of the eternal return. Origins,
Eliade argues, are not simply where we start, but what we find through the
wonders of repetition. In ritually reenacting our origin myths, for example, we
surrender chronology and self to the nothingness of acting. But while acting
the beginning, we find this moment coming to life. This is no longer <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>just</span></i>
acting: this has become <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>real</span></i>. We can feel the beginning of being
human, or Australian, or part of a family, or the particular person we are.
When we suddenly feel the presence of the creative forces that we were simply
representing a moment before, we feel the world and ourselves shift. We begin <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>now</span></i>!
Our origin has been originated, or realised, in our return to it.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>What we are feeling in this moment, however,
is never simply the first chronological moment, the past or thing we are
representing. But nor is it simply the chronological present of our
performance. Instead it is the eternity that connects the origin and its
repetitions. Just as we cannot know <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>one</span></i> until we learn its meaning through the
nothing that makes one <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i> two, we cannot know the origin in
itself, for creation always involves first <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i> second. In feeling the point of
origin, people must also be feeling the fluttering eternity that connects the
origin and its repetition. Creation occurs neither in the present nor the past,
but in the eternal that lends its glow and authority to any particular counting
of the chronological, any particular arrangement of repetitions. When we feel
we’re <i><span style='font-style:italic'>someone</span></i>,
it’s because we’ve felt <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>life</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

Lancelot, for all his heroic action, cannot <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>find</span></i> knowledge, but the grail reveals
itself to Galahad because of the humility, respect, mercy and justice of his
encounters with mystery. Galahad knows most because he accepts most. Knowledge
doesn’t derive from wilful action or the martial triumph of light, or dark, but
is instead conceived in the purposelessness of their old friendship and their
new love. Knowledge is chiaroscuro. It is produced from the respectful tension <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>between</span></i>
light and dark, from their alluring dance, from the endlessly changing
in-between space where consciousness, as diaphanous as silk, opens to the
whispers of mystery. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Rather than being a finite amount of
ignorance to be conquered and enlightened, darkness is the blessed excess that
leads us on and gives light its character, and the light that guides readers
and writers is one that augments, embraces, illuminates and highlights the
resource of darkness. Because the task of art and thought is to deepen mystery,
knowledge is the glimmer connected to a fertile darkness. It’s a whisper that
suggests the richness of a secret, the fullness of a silence; it’s the position
that indicates an invisible prepositional nothingness. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
  <li>
    <p><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>As the known and mysterious exist in
relation, they find <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>and</span></i> create each other. The mystery to be
known, however, is necessarily excessive, just out of reach, and the relation
with it is voluptuous. Truth isn’t for apprehension, arresting, gripping or
owning, but for caressing and receiving. Knowledge isn’t a military force that
swells inexorably as it feeds on enemy territory: it is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-style:italic'>shedding</span></i>
of light, an augmentation of knowledge that simultaneously involves unlearning,
forgetting, the development of simplicity and the development and appreciation
of new mysteries. Knowledge is a relation of give and take, at once gift and
act of gratitude. Without the giving away of knowledge, there can be no wonder.
And without wonder we cannot recreate the world through our representations of
it.</span><P></LI>
