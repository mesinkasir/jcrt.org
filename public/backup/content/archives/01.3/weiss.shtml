digerati, February 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Poised against

an ominous backdrop, “cybernetics pioneer” Kevin Warwick stands with his shirt

sleeve rolled up ready for a fix. But in this case “the fix” is a superimposed

x-ray image disclosing a glass-enclosed microchip surgically implanted in

Warwick’s left arm. Warwick, the cover announces, is upgrading the human

body—starting with himself. “Cyborg 1.0,” the accompanying article penned by

Warwick, outlines his plan to become one with his computer. Writes Warwick: “I

was born human. But this was an accident of fate—a condition merely of time and

place. I believe it’s something we have the power to change. I will tell you

why” (145). Warwick intends to implant a chip in his arm that will send signals

back and forth between his nervous system and a computer. For Warwick, being

human is merely an accident of time and place, an accident that given the right

computing power and the right cybernetics, we might well be able to “fix.”<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>





  <li>Two months later <i>Wired</i> has had a change of

heart—speaking only figuratively at this point in time. The cover of the April

2000 edition features a crumpled page, torn perhaps from a dictionary, maybe <i>Webster’s

Twenty-first Century Unabridged</i>. On this discarded page we read: “<b>human</b>

adj. 1. of, belonging to, or typical of the extinct species <i>Homo sapiens</i>

&lt;the human race&gt; 2. what consisted of or was produced by <i>Homo sapiens</i>

&lt;human society&gt; n. an extinct biped, <i>Homo Sapiens</i>, characterized

by carbon-based anatomy; also HUMAN BEING.” Bill Joy, cofounder and Chief

Scientist of Sun Microsystems, has been having second thoughts about the

computer revolution and in his article “Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us”

explores how it is that “our most powerful 21<sup>st</sup>-century

technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech—are threatening to

make humans an endangered species” (238). It’s time, Joy thinks, to wake up and

smell the Terminator.<P></li>

  <li>Human or posthuman? It’s time to take sides! Is human being

something to be fixed, to be gotten over? Or, are we an endangered species who

ought to be fighting back against the relentless incursion of the silicon

brigade? At the close of the twentieth century and the opening of the

twenty-first, this may well prove to be the central issue. In <i>The War of

Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age</i> Allucquere<i> </i>Rosanne

Stone suggests that we are in the midst of a paradigm shift from the mechanical

age to the virtual age and we now inhabit the cyborg habitat of the

technosocial, in which technology is viewed as natural and human nature becomes

a cultural construct. The ubiquity of technology, Stone suggests, rearranges

our thinking apparatus and calls into question “the structure of meaning

production by which we recognize each other as human” (173). Similarly, Mark

Poster argues that in the mode of information a symbiotic merger between human

and machine is taking place, “one,” he writes, “that threatens the stability of

our sense of the boundary of the human body in the world. What may be happening

is that human beings create computers and then computers create a new species

of humans” (4). In <i>The Age of Spiritual Machines</i>, Ray Kurzweil argues,

“the primary political and philosophical issue of the next century will be the

definition of who we are” (2). Ed Regis explores our “transhuman,

postbiological” future in <i>Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition</i>,

suggesting that perhaps the human condition is a condition “to be gotten out

of” (175). O. B. Hardison too suggests that the human being is flawed and that

the relation between carbon man and our silicon devices is “like the relation

between the caterpillar and the iridescent, winged creature that the

caterpillar unconsciously prepares to become” (335).<P></li>

  <li>Lest we get caught up in this wave of posthuman euphoria, we

need only recall the (paradoxical?) sight of proto-cyborgs, their cell phones,

palm pilots, pagers and other personal internet devices strapped to their

sides, queuing up to see <i>The Matrix</i>. This most recent entry from

Hollywood pitting humans against machines imagines a future in which human

beings become little more than battery packs for computers, who hold us hostage

by generating a virtual reality twentieth century to preoccupy us and keep us

busy while they feed off of our bodies’ electromagnetic energy. The movie’s

hero, Neo, is “the one” who will lead human beings in their revolution against

the dominance of machines. <i>The Matrix</i> celebrates human emotion,

intuition, love, and, especially, our capacity to transcend the limited,

inhuman, even anti-human machine. Joseph Weizenbaum, in <i>Computer Power and

Human Reason</i>, labels obscene any projects that propose to substitute a

computer system for a human function that involves interpersonal respect,

understanding, and love (269). Weizenbaum argues that there are important

differences between humans and computers and we dehumanize human beings by

adopting computers as a metaphor for understanding ourselves. Sven Birkerts

agrees that we may be on the verge of species mutation but argues that this

mutation pits technology against soul. “My use of soul is secular. I mean it to

stand for inwardness, for that awareness we carry of ourselves as mysterious

creatures at large in the universe. The soul is that part of us that smelts

meaning and tries to derive a sense of purpose from experience” (212). Others,

such as Stephen Talbott in <i>The Future Does Not Compute</i>, Alan Woolfe’s <i>The

Human Difference</i>, and Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus in <i>Mind Over Machine</i>,

agree with Birkerts and Weizenbaum that the computer threatens what is most

distinctive about humanity.<P></li>

  <li>It is amidst this constellation of ideas that N. Katherine

Hayles’ book <i>How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics,

Literature, and Informatics</i> (U of Chicago P, 1999) proves most useful.

Hayles challenges the often simplistic human-posthuman dichotomy that motivates

much of this work and attempts to articulate a framework in which to rethink

the relationship between human beings and intelligent machines. For Hayles, the

key battleground isn’t over human versus posthuman. It’s over what kind of

posthuman future we will have. As the title of Hayles’ book makes clear, we

have already become posthuman. “Increasingly the question is not whether we

will become posthuman, for posthumanity is already here. Rather, the question

is what kind of posthumans we will be” (246).<P></li>

  <li>At the center of Hayles’ text is a complex recounting of the

history of cybernetics and the construction of the currently dominant view of

the posthuman common to Kurzweil, Hardison, Warwick, and robotics researchers

such as Hans Moravec. In <i>Mind Children</i> and <i>Robot</i>, Moravec

imagines a future in which it would be possible to liberate the <span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>mind</span> from its biological substratum,

transplanting it, layer by layer, into a computer. Moravec suggests that a

person's identity would be preserved in such a process because the essence of a

person, his/her self-identity, is the pattern and the process going on in one's

head and not the machinery supporting that process. The final stage of this

process comes when we move the mind into cyberspace itself, completely freed

from any body-image, achieving the ideal of a “truly bodiless mind,” nothing

but pure mind. <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> argues that this dominant image

of the posthuman recuperates the worst aspects of liberal humanist

subjectivity, especially the erasure of human embodiment. By separating

information and materiality, marginalizing materiality, and making information,

patterns of ones and zeros, the essential characteristic of information

processing devices, mechanical and human alike, the cybernetic view of the

posthuman perpetuates a long tradition in Western thought of downplaying the

materiality of the body. <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> is meant, as Hayles

puts it, as a rememory: “putting back together parts that have lost touch with

one another and reaching out toward a complexity too unruly to fit into disembodied

ones and zeros” (13).<P></li>

  <li>But Hayles’ critique of the cybernetic view of the posthuman

is neither motivated by the memory of some unadulterated, natural humanity nor

by the triumph of Western humanism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Indeed, part of the problem of the conception of the posthuman common to

techno-enthusiasts is that it shares too many points with the human, as least

the version of the human that Hayles concentrates on, liberal humanist

subjectivity, which she identifies with possessive individualism and the

emphasis on ownership, autonomy, and individuality (3). Hayles attempts to

articulate an alternative vision of the posthuman that isn’t corrupted by the

last vestiges of liberal humanist subjectivity. We should not fear the

posthuman, Hayles argues, for it opens up the possibility of new ways of

thinking about what being human means (285).

<blockquote>

    <p>If my nightmare is a culture inhabited by posthumans

who regard their bodies as fashion accessories rather than the ground of being,

my dream is a version of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of

information technologies without being seduced by fantasies of unlimited power

and disembodied immortality, that recognizes and celebrates human finitude as a

condition of human being, and that understands human life is embedded in a

material world of great complexity, one on which we depend for our continued

survival. (5)

</blockquote><P></li>

  <li><i>How We Became Posthuman</i> tells three interrelated

stories. The first has to do with the reification of information, how

information “came to be conceptualized as an entity separate from the material

form in which it is thought to be embedded” (2). Hayles’ rich history and

detailed reading of the manuscripts of the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, a

series of interdisciplinary conferences that brought together leading

researchers in cybernetics, computational theory, neurophysiology, psychology

and other disciplines, details how a specific conception of information,

Shannon and Wiener’s decontextualized theory of information which formalized

information as an objective, mathematical quantity entirely divorced from

meaning, came to influence researchers’ work in a variety of fields, often

far-removed from the abstract realm of information theory. The second story

Hayles tells concerns the cultural and technological construction of the

cyborg. Having conceived information as something that could be calculated as

the same value regardless of the context in which it was embedded, it was a

short move, as Hayles explains, to seeing information as a free-floating entity

that “can flow between carbon-based organic components and silicon-based

electronic components to make protein and silicon operate as a single system”

(2), thereby giving birth to the cyborg. Hayles’ third story relates the

transformation of the human into the posthuman. Hayles offers the following

characterization of the posthuman (2-3):<P>

    <ol type="A">

      <li>The

     posthuman view privileges informational pattern over material

     instantiation, so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an

     accident of history rather than an inevitability of life.<P></li>

      <li>The

     posthuman view considers consciousness as an epiphenomenona, as an

     evolutionary upstart trying to claim that it is the whole show when in

     actuality it is only a minor sideshow.<P></li>

      <li>The

     posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn

     to manipulate, so that extending or replacing the body with other

     prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were

     born.<P></li>

      <li>The

     posthuman view configures human being so that it can be seamlessly

     articulated with intelligent machines. In the posthuman, there are no

     essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence

     and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism,

     robot teleology and human goals.<P></li>

    </ol>

<P></li>

  <li>It is this particular construction of the posthuman that is

central to Hayles’ examination of the history of cybernetics as a discipline.

Hayles’ analysis reconstructs three waves in this history and attempts to show

how certain choices that were made were neither inevitable nor preordained. The

development of cybernetics follows a particular pattern of change that is

distinct from either Kuhnian paradigm shifts or Foucauldian epistemic shifts.

Hayles adopts the concept of seriation from archaeological anthropology to

explain the pattern of overlapping innovation and replication in the

constellation of ideas that characterized each wave of cybernetics. From one

wave to the next, there are no sharp breaks or discontinuities, Rather, as

Hayles explains, “some of the ideas composing it are discarded, others are

modified, and new ones introduced. Like the attributes composing an artifact,

the ideas in a constellation change in a patchwork pattern of old and new”

(15). A review essay such as this must fail to do justice to the depth and rich

detail of Hayles’ analysis of these waves of cybernetics. Allow me to briefly

indicate the three distinct waves or constellations of ideas and indicate some

of what Hayles’ analysis focuses on.<P></li>

  <li>The first wave of cybernetics, which Hayles dates from 1945

to 1960, took homeostasis as a central concept. At the center of the first wave

of cybernetics is the constellation of ideas that constructed information,

neuron, and cybernetic devices as similar. The key ideas in this constellation

were contributed by Claude Shannon’s work on a theory of information, Warren

McCulloch and Walter Pitts’ model of neural functioning, according to which

neurons function analogously to information-processing systems, John von

Neumann’s work on computers that processed binary code, and Norbert Wiener’s

elaboration of this cybernetic paradigm into a cosmological philosophy

embracing animals, humans, and machines. Also key to this constellation of

ideas were the artifacts built to model these processes, including the electronic

rat and homeostat. Some of Hayles’ best work is her probing analysis of the

transcripts of the Macy Conferences, where this constellation of ideas was

first elaborated and coalesced into a new way of looking at human being.

“Henceforth, humans were to be seen primarily as information-processing

entities who are essentially similar to intelligent machines” (7). Both are

characterized by their efforts to maintain steady states in a chaotic

environment (homeostasis) through the use of feedback loops.<P></li>

  <li>While first-wave cybernetics operated according to a

traditional view of scientific objectivity whereby observers are outside the

system being observed, the concept of feedback, central to the story of control

and command in cybernetics, undermines this stance. As Hayles explains, “The

objectivist view sees information flowing from the system to the observers, but

feedback can also loop through the observers, drawing them in to become part of

the system being observed” (9). It is this recognition that led to second-wave

cybernetics which Hayles dates from 1960 to 1980 and revolves around

reflexivity, making the observer part of the system. Hayles’ narrative

concentrates on the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in

developing their theory of autopoiesis. As Hayles explains, autopoietic systems

are informationally closed systems which respond to their environment in ways

determined by their self-organization. “Their one and only goal is continually

to produce and reproduce the organization that defines them as systems. Hence,

they are not only self-organizing but also are autopoietic, self-making” (10).<P></li>

  <li>The third wave of cybernetics, stretching from 1980 to the

present, Hayles identifies with artificial life and focuses on the development

from self-organizing systems to emergent systems. Proponents of artificial life

attempt to mirror the evolution of life in the computational world, creating

computer programs that instantiate evolutionary processes and constructing from

the bottom up robots and neural nets exemplifying human behavior and neural

patterns that emerge from the complex interaction of the simple elements of the

system. As Steven Levy explains,

<blockquote>

    <p>Artificial life…is devoted to the

creation and study of lifelike organisms and systems built by humans. The stuff

of this life is nonorganic matter, and its essence is information: computers

are the kilns from which these new organisms emerge. Just as medical scientists

have managed to tinker with life’s mechanisms in vitro, the biologists and

computer scientists of a-life hope to create life <i>in silico</i>.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(5)

</blockquote>

<P></li>

  <li>Hayles links to each of these three waves of cybernetics a

discussion of contemporaneous science fiction. The combination of science and

literature has been central to Hayles’ previous works, including <i>The Cosmic

Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the Twentieth Century</i>

(Cornell UP, 1984) and <i>Chaos Bound: Orderly Disorder in Contemporary

Literature and Science</i> (Cornell UP, 1990). Literary texts, Hayles argues,

“actively shape what the technologies mean and what the scientific theories

signify in cultural contexts…culture circulates through science no less than

science circulates through culture” (21). <i>How We Became Posthuman </i>includes

excellent and insightful discussions of Bernard Wolfe’s <i>Limbo</i>, the great

works from Philip K. Dick’s middle period (including <i>The Simulacra</i>, <i>We

Can Build You</i>, <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i>, and <i>Ubik</i>),

William S. Burroughs’ <i>The Ticket that Exploded</i>,<i> </i>and four

contemporary explorations of virtuality: Greg Bear’s <i>Blood Music</i>, Cole

Perriman’s <i>Terminal Games</i>, Neil Stephenson’s <i>Snow Crash</i>, and

Richard Powers’ <i>Galatea 2.2</i>. Hayles convincingly argues that these texts

display the passageways that enabled the narrowly focused, abstract

constellation of ideas composing each wave of cybernetics to circulate more

widely in the general culture (21). Hayles’ readings of these complex texts

persuasively demonstrate her thesis that “the literary texts often reveal, as

scientific work cannot, the complex cultural, social, and representational

issues tied up with conceptual shifts and technological innovations” (24).<P></li>

  <li>Central to Hayles’ critique of the cybernetic view of the

posthuman are two issues: its reliance on abstract models that marginalize the

complexity of reality and the recuperation of liberal humanist subjectivity in

posthuman subjectivity. In her critique of the role of abstraction in

cybernetics, especially as it relates to the materiality/information

separation, Hayles identifies a common move in cybernetics which she identifies

as the Platonic backhand and the Platonic forehand. The Platonic backhand,

common to most forms of theorizing, works by inferring from the complexity of

the world simplified abstractions. The Platonic forehand, Hayles argues, is a

more recent move requiring the assistance of powerful computers to reach fully

developed forms: “The problem comes when the move circles around to constitute

the abstraction as the originary form from which the world’s multiplicity

derives. Then complexity appears as ‘fuzzing up’ of an essential reality rather

than as a manifestation of the world’s holistic nature” (12).<P></li>

  <li>Hayles’ analysis of the three waves of cybernetics returns

regularly to the manner in which embodied reality is made into a messy instantiation

of a clean and orderly abstract form. She demonstrates how models developed in

one area are transformed into multipurpose metaphors that are used to forge

connections between distinct disciplinary areas. Shannon’s original theory of

information, as an example, was, Hayles argues, appropriate in its context but

when taken out of context and appropriated by other disciplines, was mistakenly

taken to be fully commensurate with human thought.

<blockquote>

    <p>Transforming the body into a flow of binary code

pulsing through neurons was an essential step in seeing human being as an

informational pattern. In context this transformation can be seen as a

necessary simplification that made an important contribution to

neurophysiology. Taken out of context, it is extrapolated to the unwarranted

conclusion that there is no essential difference between thought and code.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(61)

</blockquote><P></li>

  <li>The McCullough-Pitts neuron is another example in which a

simplified model is used to “forge connections between relatively simple neural

circuits and the complexities of embodied experience” (57). Hayles persuasively

demonstrates the power of analogy as the main rhetorical trope in Wiener’s <i>The

Human Use of Human Beings</i>, arguing that cybernetics, as a discipline, could

not have been created without analogy (91). Analogy and metaphor are also the

central ingredients in the narratives of artificial life that underwrite the

claim that computer codes are alive and that computer programs replicating in

computers are living organisms. Hayles’ analysis of the rhetoric of artificial

life enthusiasts demonstrates how, as she puts it, “analogy is not incidental

or belated but is central too the program’s [of artificial life] artifactual

design” (228).<P></li>

  <li>It is precisely these analogies, metaphors, and narratives

that permit the researchers in cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and

artificial life to elide the difference between disembodied information and

embodied materiality. The abstract models, mechanisms and rhetorical tropes

appropriate to the rarefied theorizing of the science lab are mistakenly taken

to objectively represent reality and anything that doesn’t fit the model,

including embodiment, complexity, ambiguity, particularity, and specificity,

what Hayles sometimes refers to as the “prolix noise of materiality,” (22) is

seen as marginal and inessential.<P></li>

  <li>Hayles also persuasively argues that this cybernetic vision

of the posthuman recuperates many of the worst aspects of liberal humanist

subjectivity, which she suggests is deeply entwined with projects of domination

and oppression (5). Hayles draws on C. B. Macpherson’s analysis of possessive

individualism in identifying liberal humanism with the claims that the

individual is the proprietor of his own person or capacities and the human

essence lies in freedom (3). She later identifies as the values of liberal

humanism “a coherent, rational self, the right of that self to autonomy, and a

sense of agency linked with a belief in enlightened self-interest” (85-86).

Perhaps the central paradox in cybernetic versions of the posthuman is its

simultaneous deconstruction of some aspects of liberal humanism and its

recuperation of still others. The posthuman subject is an amalgam of biological

and mechanical parts, “a material-informational entity whose boundaries undergo

continuous construction and reconstruction” (3), undermining any clear

distinction between self and non-self.<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    When system boundaries are defined by information

flows and feedback loops rather than epidermal surfaces, the subject becomes a

system to be assembled and disassembled rather than an entity whose organic

wholeness can be assumed. (160).

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="19">

  <li>Thus the posthuman presents an opportunity to deconstruct

the natural self that has been the ground of liberal humanism. But as Hayles’

analysis of Wiener’s first-wave version and Maturana’s second-wave version of

cybernetics makes clear, these deconstructive tendencies were actively resisted

and both men crafted theories preserving autonomy, individuality, and

impermeable boundaries. Wiener tries to control the potential of cybernetics to

dissolve the subject by reinstating it within the circle of liberal humanist

assumptions. Similarly, Hayles argues that Maturana’s autopoietic theory both

contests and reinscribes liberal humanist subjectivity, preserving the autonomy

and individuality characteristic of liberal humanism.<P></li>

  <li>Hayles’ dream, as we have seen, is to articulate a version

of the posthuman purged of these vestiges of liberal humanism while

simultaneously ensuring that human embodiment is not erased. While Hayles never

explicitly spells out this alternative version of the posthuman, the outline of

her vision can be gathered from her more positive remarks and attending to the

views of those with whom she seems to be in agreement. Central to this

alternative version of the posthuman is a framework for understanding

embodiment and a distributed, emergent version of subjectivity.<P></li>

  <li>A central component of the positive vision of <i>How We

Became Posthuman</i> is Hayles’ framework for understanding embodiment and

moving beyond the information/materiality dichotomy. As she says, she hopes to

“mix things up enough so that the emphasis falls not on the separation of

matter and information but on their inextricably complex compoundings and

entwinings” (23). Hayles adopts a framework for understanding the body with strong connections

to the work of Hubert Dreyfus (his phenomenologically-based critique of

artificial intelligence), Pierre Bourdieu (his concept of “habitus”), Mark

Johnson’s discussion of “the body in the mind,” and Paul Connerton’s discussion

of ritual in <i>How Societies Remember</i>. Her framework, presented in chapter

eight “The Materiality of Informatics”, presents the body/embodiment and

inscription/incorporation as two axes constituting a field in which bodies may

take shape. By “the body” Hayles understands an idealized form, an abstract,

general, normative conception of the decontextualized body. It is this body

that disappears into information. “Embodiment” refers to the specific,

contextual particularities of given bodies, the individual articulations of the

body, with which it is in continual interaction.<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    Whereas the body is an idealized form that gestures

toward a Platonic reality, embodiment is the specific instantiation generated

from the noise of difference. Relative to the body, embodiment is other and

elsewhere, at once excessive and deficient in its infinite variations,

particularities, and abnormalities. (196-97)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="23">

  <li>Incorporating practices are actions “encoded into bodily

memory by repeated performances” until they become habitual (199). Hayles cites

as an example a person waving good-bye. The wave is an incorporated practice

that cannot be separated from its embodied medium. You can abstract a sign from

the gesture, representing it in a different medium, but then the gesture has

been transformed into an inscription, which denotes the level of discourse.

Embodiment is to incorporation as the body is to inscription.<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    Incorporation emerges from the collaboration between

the body and embodiment, between the abstract model and the specific contexts

in which the model is instantiated. In contrast to inscription, which can be

transported from context to context once it has been performed, incorporation

can never be cut entirely free from its context. (200)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="24">

  <li><span style='font-weight:normal'>To go with this framework for

understanding embodiment, Hayles accepts a cybernetic view of the self. The

self should no longer be identified with the conscious mind but as an emergent

property, the outcome of autonomous agents acting together. She cites approvingly

the work of Francisco Varela, Sherry Turkle, Allucquère Roseanne Stone, Rodney

Brooks, and the evolutionary psychology of Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby, in

support of a decentered, distributed notion of the self. Hayles portrays

herself as a “posthuman collectivity”:<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    Speaking for myself, I now find myself saying things

like, “Well, my sleep agent wants to rest, but my food agent says I should go

to the store.” Each person who thinks this way begins to envision herself or

himself as a posthuman collectivity, an I transformed into the we of autonomous

agents operating together to make a self. The infectious power of this way of

thinking gives “we” a performative dimension. People become posthuman because

they think they are posthuman. (6)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="25">

  <li>Among these autonomous agents, the conscious mind is merely

a small subsystem “running its program of self-construction and self-assurance

while remaining ignorant of the actual dynamics of complex systems” (286).

Conscious agency, control, mastery are not the essence of human identity, but

“merely the story consciousness tells itself to explain results that actually

come about through chaotic dynamics and emergent structures” (288).<P></li>

  <li>Hayles then uses these accounts of embodiment and

distributed cognition to help us understand our relationship to the posthuman

and to intelligent machines. On the one hand, because we are embodied, there is

an essential difference between human beings and intelligent machines:<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Human being

is first of all embodied being, and the complexities of this embodiment mean

that human awareness unfolds in ways very different from those of intelligence

embodied in cybernetic machines .…There is a limit to how seamlessly humans can

be articulated with intelligent machines, which remain distinctively different

from humans in their embodiments” (283-84). <o:p></o:p></span>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="27">

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Embodiment is such

that it is essential to our nature as either humans or posthumans and we need

not fear the posthuman as completely erasing that which is distinctively human

about us. On the other hand, understanding subjectivity as emergent and

distributed, has implications for rethinking the articulation of humans with

intelligent machines. Hayles imagines an environment in which technology

compensates for the “bottleneck” of human attention and we give up conscious

agency and turn over the power to make sophisticated judgments to intelligent

machines, who can manage in this environment more accurately than humans.

Cognition and decision making would be distributed between humans and nonhuman

agents. Humans become part of a distributed system. <o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>No longer

is human will seen as the source from which emanates the mastery necessary to

dominate and control the environment. Rather, the distributed cognition of the

emergent human subject correlates with…the distributed cognitive system as a

whole, in which thinking is done by both human and nonhuman actors .…When the

human is seen as part of a distributed system, the full expression of human

capability can be seen precisely to </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>depend</i><span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> on the splice rather than being imperiled

by it. (290) <o:p></o:p></span>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="28">

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>We can extend our

functional capabilities as we expand the parameters of the cognitive system we

inhabit, extending embodied awareness in ways that wouldn’t be possible without

electronic prostheses (291).<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <li>What are we to make of this alternative vision of the

posthuman? Shall we stand with Hayles on the side of the posthuman, exhilarated

at the prospect of the possibilities of coupling with machines, finding

pleasure in extending our awareness in the splice with the machine? I’m not so

sure. Hayles has undoubtedly done a great service in her careful and probing

reading of cybernetics, both fact and fiction. Her critique of how “information

lost its body” is persuasive and presents a cautionary tale that ought to be

necessary reading for today’s techno-enthusiasts and visionaries. Where <i>How

We Became Posthuman</i> falters is in its articulation of an alternative

posthuman view to that of cybernetics. As she summarizes her account of the

posthuman, Hayles emphasizes its key points:<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    In this account, emergence replaces teleology;

reflexive epistemology replaces objectivism; distributed cognition replaces

autonomous will; embodiment replaces a body seen as a support system for the

mind; and a dynamic partnership between humans and intelligent machines

replaces the liberal humanist subject’s manifest destiny to dominant and

control nature. (288)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="30">

  <li>Allow me to examine several points key to this account:

reflexive epistemology, embodiment, and distributed cognition.<P></li>

  <li>Hayles argues that a key factor in the shift from first-wave

to second-wave cybernetics was reflexivity, the issue of how to take into

account the role of the observer constructing the system. She demonstrates how

objections from figures such as Frank Fremont-Smith, Lawrence Kubie, and

Gregory Bateson revolved around the necessity of<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>incorporating reflexivity into the system. This becomes a

defining feature of second-wave autopoietic theory. Hayles cites approvingly

what she refers to as Maturana and Varela’s “epistemological revolution” (131).

The “cybernetic epistemology” characteristic of second-wave cybernetics

emphasized that living systems operate within the boundaries of an organization

that closes in on itself and leaves the world on the outside” (136).

Perception, Hayles explains, is not fundamentally representational. “Certainly

there is something ‘out there,’ which for lack of a better term we can call

‘reality.’ But it comes into existence for us, and for all living creatures, <i>only

through interactive processes determined solely by the organism’s own

organization</i>” (136, italics in the original). The posthuman, Hayles

suggests, undermines the realist, objectivist epistemology characteristic of

first-wave cybernetic, for reflexivity destabilizes objectivist assumptions

(220). And she is in fact critical of Maturana for failing to adhere more

strictly to this non-objectivist framework in the development of his thought,

for reinscribing conventional realist assumptions of scientific discourse

(135).<P></li>

  <li>But Hayles herself seems to fall victim to this same

problem. In discussing posthuman subjectivity, Hayles suggests that conscious

agency and control is an illusion. “The very illusion of control bespeaks a

fundamental ignorance about the nature of the emergent processes through which

consciousness, the organism, and the environment are constituted” (288). She

cites approvingly Varela’s contention that the self is merely a story

consciousness tells itself, but it is a false story we tell ourselves to block

out the fear and panic that would ensue if we realized there is no essential

self. “Opposed to the false unity and self-presence of grasping consciousness

is true awareness, which is based on actualizing within the mind an embodied

realization of the person’s ongoing processes” (156). Consciousness, Hayles

suggests following Varela, is a cognitive balloon that must be burst “if humans

are to recognize the true nature of their being” (156). She refers to earlier

forms of subjectivity as the “mistakes of the past” (288). And Hayles’ appropriation

of distributed cognition is premised upon cognitive science disclosing the true

nature of the self and deconstructing the falsity of unified, liberal

subjectivity. She seems to suggest that evolutionary psychology presents us

with a scientific, and therefore correct, view of human nature that gives us

access to the universal structures of human behavior.

    <blockquote><p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

italic'>Although human behavior varies across a wide spectrum of actualization,

it nevertheless has an underlying universal structure determined by evolutionary

adaptations. Thus a </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>science</i><span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> of evolutionary psychology is possible, for

the existence of a universal underlying structure guarantees the regularities

that any science needs in order to formulate coherent and consistent knowledge.

(242, italics in the original)<o:p></o:p></span>

</blockquote><P></li>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Hayles returns to

this point later in her concluding chapter where she comments again on

reflexivity. She observes that the reflexivity that looms large in cybernetics

also inhabits evolutionary biology. “The models proposed by evolutionary

biologists have encoded within them cultural attitudes and assumptions formed

by the same history they propose to analyze; as with cybernetics, observer and

system are reflexively bound up with one another” (284). She specifically cites

in this regard the evolutionary psychology of Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby as an

example of how information technologies shape contemporary worldviews. But she

goes on to discount the impact of this point on evolutionary psychology,

suggesting that their view of the body captures its essential nature:

“Nevertheless, these reflexive complexities do not negate the importance of the

sedimented history incarnated within the body” (284).<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <li>The discourses of cognitive psychology, evolutionary

psychology, and biology are key underpinnings of Hayles’ alternative account of

the posthuman. Yet, she doesn’t sufficiently attend to the status of these

discourses nor critically examine her own relationship to the system she is

observing, from which all historical contingency has been erased. While

criticizing Wiener and Maturana for adhering too closely to the realist,

objectivist discourse of the sciences, Hayles seems to fall victim to the same

problem. Her key distinction between the true awareness of the distributed self

and the false unified self would seem hard to maintain in light of the

reflexive epistemology she adopts.<P></li>

  <li>Equally key to Hayles’ account of the posthuman is a clear

understanding of embodiment and certainly the account of her framework in the

eighth chapter of <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> is worthwhile and important

for its emphasis on the particularities of embodiment and its discussion of

incorporating practices. Yet Hayles doesn’t adhere as closely to this framework

as she should and both her earlier and later discussions of the body complicate

it. While in chapter eight Hayles observes a clear distinction between the body

and embodiment, throughout the text she freely interchanges a variety of terms,

including “body,” “embodiment,” “flesh,” and “materiality.” This unnecessarily

complicates her framework for thinking about the body. Consider, for instance,

her discussion in the concluding chapter of the body in evolutionary

psychology.<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p></o:p></span>

<blockquote>

    <p>From an evolutionary

biologist’s point of view, modern humans, for all their technological prowess,

represent an eye blink in the history of life, a species far too recent to have

significant evolutionary impact on human biological behaviors and structures

.…The body is the net result of thousands of years of sedimented evolutionary

history, and it is naïve to think that this history does not affect human

behavior at every level of thought and action. (284)

</blockquote><P></li>

  <li>What does she mean by “the body” in this context? Recall

that Hayles contrasts the abstract “body” with the specificity and

particularity of “embodiment.” Here, her discussion of the history of the body

would seem to elide that distinction altogether. This discussion is further

complicated by fact that it implies a rather static view of the body, a view

undermined by earlier comments Hayles makes. While discussing the connections

between the body and technology, for instance, Hayles seems to suggest that the

body is in fact quite malleable:<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    When the body is revealed as a construct, subject to

radical change and redefinition, bodies of knowledge are similarly apt to be

seen as constructs, no more inevitably than the organic form that images them.

(85)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="37">

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in">Again, the meaning of “the

body” in this context is not clear. In her discussion of her own experience of

virtual reality [VR], Hayles again implies a more malleable body, potentially

at odds with her account of the body in evolutionary psychology.<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    Working with a VR simulation, the user learns to

move his or her hand in stylized gestures that the computer can accommodate. In

the process, the neural configuration of the user’s brain experiences changes,

some of which can be long-lasting. The computer molds the human even as the

human builds the computer. (47)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="38">

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in">More endemic to Hayles’

discussion of embodiment is the manner in which it reinscribes the very kind of

dualism it is meant to overcome. Hayles’ account of the posthuman is motivated

in part by an effort to see the human being as an holistic phenomenon. She

criticizes conceiving of information as a thing separate from the medium

instantiating it as an imaginary act that constructs a holistic phenomenon as

an information/matter duality (13). She cautions that the distinctions between

body/embodiment and inscription/incorporation are merely heuristics for things

in constant interaction (193). She refers to the holistic nature of human

experience (245). Her presentation, however, regularly reinforces the idea that

these are indeed two dichotomous things. She suggests that bodily practices

have a physical reality that can never be fully assimilated into discourse

(195). The body’s competencies and skills are distinct from discourse (199).

“Abstract pattern can never fully capture the embodied actuality, unless it is

as prolix and noisy as the body itself” (22). She connects embodiment to noise,

unruly materiality, flux, and refers to the resistant materiality that marks

our experiences as living as embodied creatures (29). She refers to embodied

experience as “noisy with error” (98). Embodiment is inherently destabilizing,

a threat to hegemonic cultural constructs (197). It always deviates in some

measure from its abstract representations (199).<P></li>

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in">The resistant materiality of

the body seems to coincide, for Hayles, with the resistant materiality of the

world, and often she fails to distinguish the materiality of embodiment and the

world’s materiality. Randomness, she suggests, is “the creative ground from

which pattern can emerge” (286).<P></li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    If pattern is the realization of a certain set of

possibilities, randomness is the much, much larger set of everything else, from

phenomena that cannot be rendered coherent by a given system’s organization to

those the system cannot perceive at all. (286)

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="40">

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in">Hayles’ rhetoric suggests

the body or materiality as some brute force existing outside of discourse and

resistant to the abstractions of discourse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>It is as if there is almost something like a state of flux, chaos,

randomness from which the order of the material world and the body emerges and

yet which is resistant to that order. Forms emerge from this chaos unthinkable

in its complexity. Hayles’ explication suggests a dichotomy between discourse

and embodiment, pattern and randomness, plenitude and form that is unlike the

holistic phenomena for which she earlier argued. The difficulty here is that

Hayles would like to devise a framework giving us a way of talking about the

body responsive to its construction as discourse/information and yet not

trapped within it (193). In trying though to convey the manner of the

interaction of these polarities, Hayles does little more than the

cyberneticists she criticizes, adopting an abstract, almost mystical language

of cybernetic models, recursive feedback loops, unified fields, mutating

surfaces, multiple coding levels, randomness, and emergence and allows these

metaphors to carry a lot of the baggage of her theory.<P></li>

  <li>The resistant materiality of the body is a necessary element

in Hayles’ version of the posthuman because it is only that resistance that

forestalls the collapse of her account of the posthuman into the cybernetic dream

of the transcended body. Hayles is rightfully critical of the posthuman view

associated with Warwick, Moravec, Kurzweil and others, where the human body is

something to be gotten over, a limitation we can transcend through our union

with “the spiritual machine.” But while emphasizing the finitude and mortality

of the embodied human, Hayles too urges that we embrace the splice and extend

embodied awareness with electronic prostheses. Hayles argues that the

development of the human-computer interface and the increased imbrication of

the human into the distributed cognitive system is a “construction that has

been ongoing for thousands of years” (290). But what insures that we don’t lose

sight of our embodied finitude? What sets limits, if there are any, to this

extrusion of awareness through prosthetic devices? What is to prevent the

gradual loss of our subjective awareness of our embodiment as it increasingly

becomes part of the distributed cognitive system? For Hayles, that limit is

seemingly the body’s own resistant, prolix, noisy materiality. Rather than

overcoming several hundred years of dualism, Hayles has merely reinscribed it

at the heart of her theory.<P></li>

  <li>The last and I think most significant set of difficulties

with Hayles’ version of the posthuman has to do with her account of

subjectivity. Hayles argues that I should think of myself as a multiagent

system whose complexity has evolved from highly recursive processes being

applied to rather simple rules. There is no stable, coherent self but only autonomous

agents running programs. The self is a small subsystem running its program of

self-construction and self-assurance while remaining ignorant of the actual

dynamics of complex system. We don’t have unambiguous boundaries and shouldn’t

think of the subject as an autonomous self independent of the environment.

Hayles suggests that conscious agency and control are mere illusions, really

only a luxury of those few individuals who had the wealth, power, and leisure

to conceptualize themselves that way (286). Mastery through the exercise of

autonomous will is the story consciousness tells itself and it is a bad story,

“deeply entwined with projects of domination and oppression” (5). There are a

number of questions surrounding this view of self and subjectivity.<P></li>

  <li>I have earlier suggested that the status of Hayles’ own

account of the self is rendered questionable by difficulties in her discussion

of reflexive epistemology. Here I simply will add that her adoption of models

from cybernetics and cognitive psychology is equally questionable. Hayles has

criticized the common movement in cybernetics from the messy particularities of

embodiment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to abstract models. Yet she

herself seems to relish the uncritical adoption of cybernetic models in

accounting for her own experiences. “Speaking for myself, I now find myself

saying things like, ‘Well, my sleep agent wants to rest, but my food agent says

I should go to the store’” (6). She easily adopts the rhetoric of informational

technologies to describe the conscious mind as a subsystem running its program

of self-construction (286). Daniel Dennett, a leading proponent of cognitive

models, cautions against this kind of appropriation. Writing in <i>The Mind’s I</i>,<i>

</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Dennett points out that while

cognitivist theories abound with “deliberately fanciful homunculus

metaphors—subsystems like little people in the brain…the actual subsystems are

deemed to be unproblematic nonconscious bits of organic machinery, as utterly

lacking in point of view or inner life as a kidney or kneecap” (12). While

Hayles is rightfully critical of the way in which metaphors and analogies were

central to the disciplinary dominance of cybernetic models, she is less

critical of her own appropriation of similar metaphors and analogies in the

construction of an alternative vision of the posthuman.</span><P></li>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>In her critique of

Wiener and Maturana, Hayles chides them for reinscribing within their theories

the assumptions of liberal humanist subjectivity, particularly the assumption

of an autonomous, bounded self. Absent from these critiques, however, is any

effort to question the value of these assumptions. Hayles seemingly rejects

them out of hand. She suggests they are deeply entwined in control and

domination and a luxury of the wealthy and powerful, but these overly general and

sweeping comments are left completely unsupported. Alternatively, a number of

theorists have argued persuasively for the value of a core, bounded self. While

Hayles takes pleasure in the thought of the dissolving boundaries of the self,

Jane Flax suggests a different perspective. Flax observes that object relations

theorists offer strong arguments for the importance of a stable, core or “true”

self that while it has many of the characteristics of the postmodernist

decentered self has few of its deficiencies. As Flax, a practicing therapist

observes,<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

    <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Borderline

makes the fragmentation of experiences something other than a terrifying slide

into psychosis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(218-219)<o:p></o:p></span>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol start="45">

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in">A strongly similar point is

made by James Glass in his analysis of multiple personality disorder and

postmodernism. Oliver Sacks argues that one cannot live normally, humanly in

the world without the integrative power implied by a stable self.

Anthropologist Sheri Ortner argues that the denial of the intentional subject,

and of agency, works against the interests of women, minorities, postcolonial

and other subaltern subjects. Citing the work of José Limon, she argues that in

his study of minority populations he writes with great eloquence about the

striving for unity and a coherent life among minorities in this country. Limon

argues that “while life for working-class Mexican Americans is indeed full of

discontinuity, disruption, and fragmentation, the forms and patterns of their

dancing in south Texas dance halls represents a struggle against these things,

an effort, however momentary and inadequate, to construct a world of meaning

and coherence” (8).<P></li>

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in">It is finally this question

of agency in the context of the posthuman that Hayles never adequately

addresses. While initially suggesting that “serious consideration needs to be

given to how certain characteristics associated with the liberal subject,

especially agency and choice, can be articulated within a posthuman context,”

(5) and recognizing that the attribute of agency continues to be valued in the

face of the posthuman (279), Hayles ultimately does little more than dissolve

conscious agency and choice. Here too we might wonder about limits to the

human-computer interface. In the posthuman, the boundaries of the autonomous

subject are up for grabs (2), “the subject becomes a system to be assembled and

disassembled rather than an entity whose organic wholeness can be assumed”

(160). Hayles implies that we ought to take pleasure in the coupling that comes

in the human-machine interface. The infectious power of this way of thinking,

she suggests, excites pleasure (6). Is Hayles’ pleasure in the interface

sufficient to recommend it to us as a form of life? Wouldn’t this pleasure

finally depend on whether I chose to become part of a system? Does it not

matter who or what is doing the assembling and disassembling? <span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>When we do choose to let down our boundaries

and do take pleasure in breaching boundaries (in our erotic lives for

instance), isn’t this because we have chosen to do so, not seen ourselves as

subject to the environment?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When I

decide to become part of a system perhaps it can be experienced as pleasurable

but when I suddenly find myself part of that system and boundaries are being

ripped down, then I may just as well experience terror.<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <li>

    <p style="margin-left:0in"><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

italic'>The problem motivating these questions has to do with the very starting

point of Hayles’ analysis in </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>How

We Became Posthuman</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>, which is

premised upon a false dichotomy of sorts. </span>Hayles is clear that her

account of the posthuman is a reaction against liberal humanist subjectivity,

which takes as the ground of being possessive individualism (34). At the center

of <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> then is a choice seemingly between two

options, either the possessive individualism of Hobbes and Locke or Hayles’

version of the posthuman, which takes computation as its ground. The options,

though, are somewhat more complicated than Hayles leads on.<P></li>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>While Hayles

suggests that cybernetics is central to the story of distributed cognition and

often refers to “new models of subjectivity” emerging from cognitive science

and artificial life (4), it’s not clear that this version of subjectivity is

either new or necessarily connected to cybernetics. The view of the self

critiqued by Hayles is the self as rational, autonomous, unified, centered,

stable, fixed, and unchanging, in other words, the self as described by

Descartes in his </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meditations</i><span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> and his other philosophical works</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt">.

    </span><span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Melford Spiro has argued that this

putative Western self is a straw man and takes issue with the claim that this

self represents the dominant tradition in Western thought. Spiro mentions a

long list of theorists who have proposed alternative models, a list which

includes the pragmatists William James and George Herbert Mead, David Hume’s

associationist model of the self, the psychoanalytic theories of Erik Erikson

and Heinz Kohut, and the philosophical views of Karl Popper, Isaiah Berlin, and

Marcia Cavell. In her work </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Divided

Minds and Successive Selves</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>,

Jennifer Radden, drawing again on Hume and David Parfit’s Humean analysis of

the self, convincingly demonstrates how a variety of phenomena including </span><i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>akrasia</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

italic'> or self-deception, ambivalence, and inner conflict have played a

central role in Western conceptions of the self. D. W. Murray suggests that the

essentialist, subjective selfhood that is often the point of critique is

“outside of formal theology, a recent development, most associated with the

rise of the Romanticist literary movement in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century”

(9). Murray suggests that it is not at all clear that there is a single folk

model of selfhood in the contemporary Western cultural system (18). Dorothy

Holland and Andrew Kipnis, as well, argue that their research on American

experiences of embarrassment suggests that there is heterogeneity in Western

concepts of the person. These points suggest there are more resources for

thinking about the self than the false dichotomy Hayles presents: either

possessive individualism or posthuman.<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Furthermore, while

Hayles importantly focuses on both the power of embodiment and narrative in her

critique of cybernetics, she fails to explore the manner in which either or

both may serve as a basis for the construction of a coherent self-identity.

There is a large body of literature in philosophy that explores these issues

and further complicates the ease with which Hayles presents her dichotomy.

Indeed there are a number of researchers and philosophers who accept the main

thrust of the “cognitive revolution” in philosophy of mind, psychology, and

neurophysiology who still maintain there is a basis for a core, integrated

self. Out of consideration of space, permit me to simply mention some

worthwhile entries. In </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Consciousness

Explained</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>, for instance, Daniel

Dennett argues for a view of the self he refers to as the “Center of Narrative

Gravity.”<o:p></o:p><![endif]><o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>A self,

role in the ongoing cognitive economy of that living body, because, of all the

things in the environment an active body must make mental models of, none is

more crucial than the model the agent has of itself. (428)<o:p></o:p></span>

</blockquote>

<ol start="50">

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Antonio Damasio’s

work is similarly informed by recent work in neurophysiology and cognitive

psychology and yet retains a complex view of the self and doesn’t simply

dissolve it as would Hayles. In his recent </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

a proto-self, temporary collections of neural patterns which we are not

moment to another, and an autobiographical self, “constituted by implicit

memories of multiple instances of individual experience of the past and of the

anticipated future” (174). Damasio argues that stability and boundaries were

necessary to the emergence of life and form the basis of the biological

development of all three selves (137).<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Finally, we might

briefly consider Charles Taylor’s </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sources

of the Self</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>. Like Hayles, Taylor

is very critical of what he terms the punctual or neutral self which he

identifies with Locke and contemporary Lockeans such as David Parfit. Like

Hayles, he is critical of the abstract, punctual, disengaged self

characteristic of one strain of modern thought. But Taylor identifies with a

different tradition in modern thought, one he associates to the hermeneutic

tradition and to the philosophy of Michel de Montaigne, and which forms the

basis for his view of the human being as a self-interpreting animal. Human

beings are animals who makes sense of their lives through narrative. “Making

sense of one’s life as a story is not an optional extra; our lives exist in

this space of questions, which only a coherent narrative can answer. In order

to have a sense of who we are, we have to have a notion of how we have become,

and of where we are going” (47).<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>While this is not

the place to evaluate these competing notions of the self and subjectivity,

minimally it should make clear that Hayles’ stark dichotomy between liberal

humanist subjectivity and posthuman distributed subjectivity is too starkly

drawn. While persuasively demonstrating the elision of materiality in the

cybernetic posthuman, in the rush to convince us of the pleasures of her own

version posthuman, Hayles finally elides too much herself.<o:p></o:p></span><P></li>

  <p class="footer"><b>Dennis M. Weiss </b> is Associate Professor of Philosophy in the English and

Humanities Department at York College of Pennsylvania. He received his

Ph.D. in philosophy from The University of Texas at Austin. His

interests revolve around philosophical theories of human nature,

feminist philosophy, and the digital culture. He is currently working on

an edited collection of essays on philosophical anthropology and a text

on the meaning of human being in the digital age. He has published a

number of journal essays exploring the role of philosophical

anthropology in contemporary philosophy, the impact of digital media on

human nature, and the significance of the computer culture. These essays

critique the “thin” accounts of human nature prevalent in work on the

digital culture from the perspective of the more developed, “thick”

accounts of human nature in the work of philosophical anthropologists

such as Michael Landmann, Martin Buber, Jose Ortega y Gassett, Arnold

Gehlen, and others.
