<p class=MsoNormal><IMG SRC="https://jcrt.org/images/alpha/F.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="F" ALIGN="LEFT">rom explicitly religious art to art that ‘is, but isn’t’

“religious,” from that which lies beyond art, such as objects of veneration, to

a postmodern iconography of simulacra, Andy Warhol contributes significantly to

the negotiation of twentieth, and now twenty-first, century culture in America

and beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His influence on

contemporary art, religion and culture is recognized and will continue to

increase as thinkers pursue questions about image and reality, representation, originality,

visual culture, identity, and sexuality, not to mention technology,

spirituality, business, and God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of

Warhol’s multiple contributions, several stand out in particular.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Warhol’s explicitly religious art,

especially brought to light in Jane Daggett Dillenberger’s recent publication, <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Religious Art of Andy Warhol</i>,

reveals a transformation of traditional religious images and themes into lively

twentieth century religious art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But

beyond his explicitly religious works as highlighted by Daggett Dillenberger’s

book, one can see that Warhol’s entire <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oeuvre</i>

has “religious” qualities, producing an art that ‘is, but isn’t,’

religious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further, Warhol is

significant for his part in what Jean Baudrillard calls the ‘disappearance of

art,’ a kind of transfiguration of art into objects of veneration.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, in line with Baudrillard’s thought

regarding the ‘successive phases of the image’ and the ‘disappearance of God’

into simulacra, Warhol produces images like that of Marilyn Monroe that no

longer represent reality but offer a simulacra, a never-ending play of signs

among signs stretching to infinity.</p>

<ol start="2">

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">As early as 1964, Warhol received the tag of “Saint Andy.”<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This title, however, referred more to his

immense popularity among the young Pop and independent film crowd, and to the

authentically<span style='color:red'> </span>innocent façade of Warhol’s

physical appearance than to religious devotion.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Not until his death did news of Warhol’s relationship to the

spiritual come to serious attention by the public.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>John Richardson’s eulogy of Warhol at his memorial mass at St.

Patrick’s Cathedral in the spring of 1987 asked his audience to “recall a side

of [Warhol’s] character that he hid from all but his closest friends: his

spiritual side,” calling this spirituality “the key to the artist’s

psyche.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He recalled Warhol’s devoutly

Catholic upbringing, his visits late in life to his local church, and his

assistance to the homeless at a shelter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>“To my certain knowledge,” said Richardson, “ he was responsible for at

least one conversion,” and “took considerable pride in financing a nephew’s

studies for the priesthood.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Richardson

compared Warhol to a a “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yurodstvo</i>—one

of those saintly simpletons who haunt Russian fiction and Slavic villages, such

as Mikova in Ruthenia, whence the Warhols stemmed.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>He argued that Warhol felt great compassion for the burn-outs at

The Factory (Warhol’s studio) and more than once saved them from

self-destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, he noted

that in the last few years of Warhol’s life, explicitly religious themes

revealed themselves in his art work, more importantly in the <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last Supper</i> series that constituted the

final show of his life.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2"

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Following the eulogy came several articles regarding

Warhol’s relationship to religion, especially Robert Pincus-Witten’s 1989

piece, “Pre-Margins of Error, Saint Andy’s Devotions.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1992, two important works on art and

religion appeared that included discussions of Warhol—Paul Giles’ <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>American Catholic Arts and Fictions</i> and

Mark C. Taylor’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Disfiguring: Art,

Architecture, Religion</i>.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="#_edn3"

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the fall of 1996, the very first issue of

the journal of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Religion and the Arts</i>

was dedicated to Warhol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This issue

featured an introduction by Revo Wolf, and articles by Zan Schuweiler Daab and

Jane Daggett Dillenberger.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4"

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Up to this point, reported Wolf, most art

critical works took no account of Warhol’s relationship to Catholicism, nor how

that relationship figured into his work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>But, she continues, “Warhol and Catholicism has now become a subject of

intellectual inquiry.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5"

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1997, Raymond Herbenick published <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Andy Warhol’s Religious and Ethnic Roots:

The Carpatho-Rusyn Influence on his Art</i>, primarily a review of a number of

texts on Warhol read from the author’s personal knowledge of<span

Dillenberger’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Religious Art of Andy

work to date on the subject of Warhol’s relationship to religion.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She begins retracing much of the important

biographical material related to Warhol’s religious upbringing.<span

presenting Warhol’s explicitly religious art.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Daggett Dillenberger reports that from an early age art and

religion intermingled for Warhol. Baptized as a child at St. John Chrysostom

Byzantine Catholic Church, Andy and his family regularly attended and had

plenty of time to consider the elaborate iconostasis screen with its many

devotional images.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In contrast to

Western Catholic churches where sculptures and paintings invite private

devotion and cultivate an atmosphere for worship, Byzantine churches especially

venerate “the visual image, the religious icon, which engages the viewer,

having a function equivalent to that of scripture.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Most of the rooms in the Warhola home had an icon; a replication

of Leonardo’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last Supper</i> and a

crucifix were also to be found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daggett

Dillenberger writes, “Thus, Andy’s earliest experience of art was religious

art…unlike for many Protestants or those outside the churches whose experience

of religious art may have been limited to museums, for Andy, art and religion

were linked from a very early age.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn7' href="#_edn7"

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></a><P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Daggett Dillenberger begins tracing Warhol’s explicitly

religious art with his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cross</i> series

(1981-1982), made for a show in Madrid called “Guns, Knives, and Crosses.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With black background and various colors,

the large but simple military-like crosses hover in rows as in a cemetery.<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She points to his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Byzantine practice of painting eggs at Easter time.<a style='mso-endnote-id:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The series entitled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

religious material as in the reworking of Leonardo’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>The Annunciation,</i> Piero della Francesca’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>Madonna del Duca Federico</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Saint

Apollonia,</i> Paolo Uccello’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>St. George

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Warhol drew with pencil on paper a work

entitled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Modern Madonna</i> (ca.

1980-1981), “a twentieth century version of the Madonna Lactans, or the Mother

with the nursing Christ child.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn11' href="#_edn11"

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Closing her comments on Warhol’s “first

religious paintings,” she turns to his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shadows</i>

series (1978) which “unfold on walls, creating a nighttime world, a shifting

kaleidoscope of brilliant, life-full color set against black shadows of final

darkness.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They invoke “the Sublime”

with “the grandeur of conception and the delicacy of the abstract

expressionist’s most profound” spiritual works such as “[Barnett] Newman’s <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stations of the Cross </i>and Mark Rothko’s

paintings for the Rothko Chapel in Houston, and Cleve Gray’s fourteen <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Threnody</i> paintings in Purchase, New

York.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn12' href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span

    <p class="MsoNormal">Daggett Dillenberger notes Warhol’s new employment of <i

die”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span

the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Death and Disaster </i>series and the

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Skull</i> paintings.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She tells us, “Between 1962 and 1967 Warhol

did silkscreen paintings of suicides, car crashes, the atomic bomb, the

electric chair, race riots, and death by poisoning and by earthquake.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These paintings range from the gruesome <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Car Crash</i> paintings to the <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Electric Chair</i> series, which is a

meditation on mortality and death.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn14'

href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Suicide</i>

(1963), “elegiac, or meditative, in mood” is based on a photograph from <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life</i> magazine in which a twenty-three

year old woman has jumped from the observation deck of the Empire State

building and lies on the indented roof of a car.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Initially somewhat abstract, the image of the woman emerges as a

tranquil “sleeping beauty” in which a tragedy is “metamorphized” by the

repeated frames into a meditative and disturbing <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>momento mori.</i><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn15' href="#_edn15"

name="_ednref15" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The electric chair<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'> </i>paintings (1963, 1965, 1967) show the execution chamber at Sing

Sing penitentiary in New York, the last executions taking place there in 1963

when Warhol began the series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The image

shows an empty room except for the electric chair and a small sign in the

background that reads “Silence.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Warhol’s use of light and the encroachment of darkness in the repeated

frames suggest “a meditation of death.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>And, in the later single frame images such as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>Big Electric Chair </i>(1967), “the chair is transformed from a

grotesque instrument of death into a numinous object, suggesting transcendence,

much as the cross, which was used for a particularly cruel kind of execution,

is seen in Christian art as a symbol pointing to salvation.”<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, Daggett Dillenberger notes Warhol’s

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Skull </i>paintings, reminiscent of the

seventeenth-century <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vanitas </i>portraits

in which the figure is juxtaposed by a skull, reminding the viewer of “the

transience of life and the certainty of death.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn17'

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Daggett Dillenberger turns our attention back to Warhol’s

explicitly religious art while continuing to cite his religious allegory

through Pop symbols.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In her penultimate

chapter “Leonardo’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last Supper </i>Transformed,”

Daggett Dillenberger notes the symbolism of Warhol’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>Last Supper (Wise Potato Chips)</i> (1986) in which the traditional

supper “scene is set before us, but our attention is riveted by the huge,

brilliant blue-and-black…Wise Potato Chips logo [that] is an abstracted head of

an owl, compressed into a circular design.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>She notes the “play on the word ‘wise’” and the significance of the owl

“as a symbol of wisdom.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn18' href="#_edn18"

name="_ednref18" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Warhol’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

normal'>The Last Supper (The Big C)</i> (ca. 1985), we observe scenes from the <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last Supper</i> superimposed by images of

motorcycles, a large price tag, the Wise owl, and the words “THE BIG C,” among

other things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Besides Warhol’s explicit

reference to cancer, Daggett Dillenberger points out that “the Christ is

another <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Big C.</i>”<a style='mso-endnote-id:

edn19' href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[19]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The

Last Supper (Dove) </i>(1986) presents the complete supper scene with a large

price tag, the GE (General Electric) logo, and the word ‘Dove’ as well as the

Dove soap logo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Significantly, the

dove [logo] levitates above the head of Jesus,” as in the scriptural account of

Christ’s baptism, “‘the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon

[Jesus] in bodily form like a dove’ (Luke 3:21-22).”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>The GE logo, “‘we bring good things to light’ can be seen as a

metaphor for creation, when God separated light and darkness and found his

creation to be ‘good.’”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus we find

the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—of particular significance in the

Byzantine Catholic Church:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“GE as a

symbol for the creator, the dove for the Holy Spirit, and Jesus here delineated

at the Last Supper.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn20' href="#_edn20"

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[20]<![endif]></span></span></a><span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, among others, Daggett Dillenberger

looks to Warhol’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ten Punching Bags</i>,

a collaborative piece with Jean-Michel Basquiat that suggests the flagellation

of Christ; and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Christ 112 Times</i>, a

yellow-on-black image of Christ repeated one hundred and twelve times, like “a

visual chant.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn21' href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21"

Warhol, told how this “series appeared as an extension of the now-inaccessible

message of Leonardo’s famous masterpiece: a sort of replay and reactualization

of the original fresco, an act which took on all its symbolic value on the

white walls of the Palazzo delle Stelline,” which was a defunct convent that

had been made into a gallery situated fifty meters from the Leonardo <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last Supper</i>….Restany continued,

“Andy…seemed penetrated by the importance of the moment.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He greatly surprised me when he said to me:

‘Pierre, do you think the Italians will see the respect I have for

Leonardo?’…Consciously or not, Warhol seemed to me to having acted there as a

curator of a masterpiece of Christian culture, of maintaining a tradition he

was a part of.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn23' href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23"

<h2>The “Religious” Art of Andy Warhol</h2>



<ol start="12">

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Warhol’s transformation of religious art is not limited to

his explicitly religious art, but also to that which ‘is, but isn’t’

religious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Warhol can be seen as ritual

artist, one who uses serial repetition like a secular liturgy.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He paints the “religious” icons of

contemporary culture, the “saints” of twentieth century American pop culture,

using a communal art-making process reminiscent of early Eastern icon

painters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In his Factory, like a

medieval monastery, he turns cultural junk into ‘high’ art, the banal into

objects of devotion.<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Warhol’s art continues in a tradition not entirely unlike

the early Eastern Christian world of icon painting.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Christian iconography, like Warhol’s Pop images, originated from

the culture at-large.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Christian icons

descended “from Greek Hellenistic and Roman portraits of gods, emperors, state

officials, writers, philosophers, or, in private homes, ancestors.”<a

<h2>The Disappearance (Transfiguration) of Art</h2>



<ol start="19">

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Warhol is also significant for the way in which he enacts

what Jean Baudrillard calls the “disappearance of art,” or put another

way—art’s transfiguration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Baudrillard

argues that art has been hyperrealized, gone beyond its own limitations, and

left no essence for itself, nothing but a void.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Warhol goes the farthest in pushing art to its extreme, even

beyond its own finality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Borrowing from

Walter Benjamin, Baudrillard says Warhol opens a way for a “primary ritualism”

in which his art becomes fetish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A

fetish-object, as a valueless object, not only has no value but also is beyond

all criteria of value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this way,

Warhol’s work in its irreligious and profane forms takes on perhaps its most

important “religious value.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His images

transfigure art beyond distinctions of the religious and profane, and beyond

normal categories of judgement.<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The disappearance of art can be described as art’s

hyperrealization of itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Baudrillard

says, “The more art tries to realize itself, the more it hyperrealizes itself

to find its own empty essence.” In this case, Baudrillard gives the example of

Marcel Duchamp’s “unexpected exhibition of a wine rack in an art gallery.”<a

    <p>[Duchamp] extracted the bottle

rack from the real world…, displaced it on another level to confer on it an

undefinable hyperreality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A paradoxical

acting-out, putting an end to the bottle rack as a real object, to art as the

invention of another scene and to the artist as the protagonist of another

world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To all aesthetic idealization

Duchamp opposes a violent desublimation of art and of the real by their

instantaneous short-circuit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Extrematization of the two forms: the bottle rack, ex-inscribed from its

context, from its idea, from its function, becomes more real than real

(hyperreal), and more art than art (it enters into the transaesthetics of

banality, of insignificance, of nullity, where today the pure and indifferent

form of art is to be seen).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn55' href="#_edn55"

something that is “more beautiful than beautiful and uglier than ugly.”<span

<blockquote>

    <p>contemporary painting cultivates

not only ugliness (which is still an aesthetic value), but the uglier than the

ugly (the “bad,” the “worse,” the “kitsch”), an ugliness elevated to the second

power because it is liberated from its relationship to its contrary and

henceforth susceptible to redouble itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<h2>Divine Simulacrum</h2>



<ol start="26">

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Finally we note Warhol’s contribution to religion, art, and

culture in terms of his production of images that move beyond representation in

favor of simulacra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In light of

Baudrillard’s outline of the ‘successive phases of the image’ and his spin on

the Iconoclast debates, Warhol’s “iconography” such as that of Marilyn Monroe

emerges as the most fully imagined “reality” in postmodern culture--‘pure,’

‘unconditional simulacrum.’<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">In Baudrillard’s perhaps most important writing, “The

Precession of Simulacra”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn71' href="#_edn71"

name="_ednref71" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[71]<![endif]></span></span></a>

he discusses “the simulacrum of divinity” asking, “What becomes of divinity

when it reveals itself in icons, when it is multiplied in simulacra?”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When divinity reveals itself in images,

multiple images, an alteration of some kind takes place.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Does it remain the supreme authority,

simply incarnated in images as a visible theology?”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Or does something else happen, something more dislodging and

drastic?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When divinity is revealed in

icons, “is it volatized into simulacra which alone deploy their pomp and power

of fascination—the visible machinery of icons being substituted for the pure

and intelligible Idea of God?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is God,

as Idea, lost in his own iconography?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Baudrillard says this is the very issue that frightened the Iconoclasts

in the debate of their day.<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">[The Iconoclasts’] rage to destroy images rose

precisely because they sensed this omnipotence of simulacra, this facility they

have of erasing God from the consciousness of people, and the overwhelming,

destructive truth which they suggest: that ultimately there has never been any

God; that only simulacra exist; indeed that God himself has only ever been his

own simulacrum.<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">If the Iconoclasts were able to believe that icons simply

“occulted or masked the Platonic idea of God, there would have been no reason

to destroy them.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather their profound

fear and “metaphysical despair came from the idea that the images concealed

nothing at all, and that in fact they were not images, such as the original

model would have made them, but actually perfect simulacra forever radiant with

their own fascination.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, for the Iconoclasts

then and even now, “this death of the divine referential has to be exorcised at

all cost.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn72' href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72"

title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:

footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[72]<![endif]></span></span></a><P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The Iconoclasts, writes Baudrillard, rather than “despising

and denying images” as they are accused, “were in fact the ones that accorded

them their actual worth, unlike the iconolaters, who saw them only [as]

reflections and were content to venerate God at one remove.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand, however, the contrary can

also be said: “namely, that the iconolaters possessed the most modern and

adventurous minds, since, underneath the idea of the apparition of God in the

mirror of images, they already enacted his death and disappearance in the

epiphany of his representations.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Perhaps they already knew this, that images “no longer represented

anything, and that they were purely a game.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>But this is no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mere</i> game;

rather “this was precisely the greatest game.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>They perhaps knew also, suggests Baudrillard, how “dangerous” it is to

“unmask images, since they dissimulate the fact that there is nothing behind

them.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn73' href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73" title=""><span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[73]<![endif]></span></span></a>

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Images have the power to murder: to be

“murderers of the real; murderers of their own model as the Byzantine icons

could murder the divine identity.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He

writes,

<blockquote>

    <p>To this murderous capacity is

opposed the dialectical capacity of representations as a visible and

intelligible mediation of the real.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All

of Western faith…was engaged in this wager on representations: that a sign

could refer to the depth of meaning and that something could guarantee this

exchange—God, of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But what if

God himself can be simulated, that is to say, reduced to the signs which attest

to his existence?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then the whole system

becomes weightless; it is no longer anything but a gigantic simulacrum: not

unreal, but a simulacrum, never again exchanging for what is real, but exchanging

in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference.<a

style='mso-endnote-id:edn74' href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title=""><span

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[74]<![endif]></span></span></a>

</blockquote><P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">God disappears into simulacrum.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>He ‘dies’ or is ‘murdered’ in the sense that the real is overcome

by the hyperreal.<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">This signals the end of representation and the emergence of

simulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Simply stated,

“Representation starts from the principle that the sign and the real are

equivalent,” adding that “even if this equivalence is Utopian, it is a

fundamental axiom.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand,

“simulation starts from the Utopia of this principle of equivalence, <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from the radical negation of sign as value,</i>

from the sign as reversion and death sentence of every reference.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While “representation tries to absorb

simulation by interpreting it as false representation, simulation envelops the

whole edifice of representation as itself a simulacrum.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Baudrillard’s “successive phases of the

image” then are the following:<p>

    <ol>

      <li><![if !supportLists]>It is the reflection of a basic reality.</li>

      <li><![if !supportLists]>It masks and perverts a basic reality.</li>

      <li><![if !supportLists]>It masks the <i>absence</i>

<ol start="33">

  <li>

    <p class="MsoNormal">This marks a decisive turning point: “The transition from

signs which dissimulate something to signs which dissimulate that there is

nothing.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The former “implies a

theology of truth and secrecy (to which the notion of ideology still belongs),”

while the latter “inaugurates an age of simulacra and simulation, in which

there is no longer any God to recognize his own, nor any last judgment to

separate truth from false, the real from its artificial resurrection, since

everything is already dead and risen in advance.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn76'

we consider further, we recognize that even the “real” Marilyn at the photo

“original” name, Norma Jeane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even at

Marilyn?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is Norma Jeane necessarily

Borges’ fable where the territory and the map are caught up into simulacra,

does in most of his work; in Baudrillard’s terms: producing ‘pure’

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal">Warhol

“himself” is another prime example of this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>For Baudrillard, he is a simulacrum, a sign among signs, testifying to

the disappearance of the divine referential or to any profound reality, an

indication of the void which exists beyond his iconography, leaving only a

‘pure,’ ‘divine’ simulacrum behind.<P></LI>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal">When

Baudrillard suggests “the critic of religion and of its official manifestation

misses the fact that religion is in practice far more realized in many other

forms—irreligious, profane, political or cultural—where it is less easily

recognizable as such,”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn77' href="#_edn77"

we now immediately think of Warhol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The

contribution of the ‘pope of Pop’ lies not only in what can be deemed explicitly

religious art as Daggett Dillenberger has shown us in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

conventional definitions of religion and art to a “religious art” that is

perhaps more religious than religious and more art than art.<span

the “new objects beyond aesthetics, transaesthetic—fetish-objects without

signification, without illusion, without aura, without value….a pure visual

product….Unconditional simulacrum.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn78'

Baudrillard, “Fatal Strategies,” 187-188.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>A quite literal example of the disappearance of art is to be found at

Warhol’s famous opening in the early 1960’s in which the crowd had become “so

dense and excited” that the gallery director had to take down all the

paintings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, an art opening without

any art!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course, as Danto points

out, Warhol himself was also the art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>He says, “The artist later murmured at the wry irony of an exhibition

without paintings, but it was, strictly speaking, not an exhibition without <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>art</i>, for he had, already, become one

with his image, and in the definitive catalogue of his work, his life must be

registered as an item.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I agree with

Danto but, in line with Baudrillard, suggest that this is not “art” as we have

known it to be, that art that has been radically altered.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Warhol himself becomes an art beyond the

art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>See Arthur C. Danto, “Who Was Andy
