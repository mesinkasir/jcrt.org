the 1980s and 1990s, Americans saw their country torn apart over issues of

“political correctness,” the right-wing rhetorical hot button used to discredit

a more liberal appreciation of our nation’s multiculturalism.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The so-called culture wars of the last two

decades made evident the deep ideological divides that exist in this country

over issues of race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two recent books, both published by

Routledge, examine the way in which religion and spirituality has been part of

the fray.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>One Nation Under God?:

Religion and American Culture</i> (1999), edited by Marjorie Garber and Rebecca

L. Walkowitz, investigates, in fifteen separate but complementary essays, the

practical effects of these culture wars on religion.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>The theoretical implications of a decidedly postmodern outlook on

religion and culture are examined in Victor E. Taylor’s <i>Para/Inquiry:

Postmodern Religion and Culture</i> (2000).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

vocabulary that emerged from the conservative right during the Reagan and Bush

administrations has since become part of the vernacular.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Republic Revolution, as Newt Gingrich

dubbed it, attacked the “cultural elite,” labeling its multicultural project

and attendant causes as “political correctness” or PC.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rush Limbaugh cheered on angry white males

who themselves assailed newly-empowered women as “feminazis.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For their part, pro-life anti-abortion

rights activists labeled their pro-choice opponents as “pro-death.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, as if to forget their own point, the

more extreme elements added bombs to their message, killing and injuring

physicians and nurses at family planning clinics.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Rhetoric

and imagery married to violence compromised the fulfillment of the kindler,

gentler nation envisioned by George Bush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>As a nation, we sat bleary-eyed as we watched George Holliday’s

videotape of the beating of Rodney King by L.A. police officers in March of 1991.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The officers’ acquittal in April of 1992

caused the worst race riots in recent memory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Since then, terrible events continue to occur.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>White supremacist radicals in Jasper, Texas, dragged a black man

to his death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>African American churches

have been bombed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The innocent question

of Rodney King—“Can’t we all just get along?”—still rings in our ears. <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Eventually,

the battle lines were redrawn, given the bully pulpit afforded liberals by the

election of a Democrat to the White House in 1992.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Something different was clearly taking place on January 20, 1993,

when Maya Angelou delivered her poem “On the Pulse of Morning” at William

Jefferson Clinton’s inauguration as the nation’s forty-second president.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Angelou declared this to be an historic

opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The horizon leans

forward,” she said, “Offering you space to place new steps of change.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Angelou’s words—and Clinton’s choice of

Angelou as inaugural poet—marked a clarion call in the battle over differing

cultural ideologies that had been waging for some time.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Suddenly, both message and messenger were

different.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Garber

and Walkowitz’ <i>One Nation Under God?</i> documents how religious conflict

has been imbricated in all those other conflicts of our culture wars these past

two decades, under both conservative and liberal leadership.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The broad scope of the collection can be

seen in three representative essays.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

collection’s opening piece, Diana L. Eck’s “The Multireligious Public Square,”

sets the stage brilliantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What does a

country that prides itself on free expression and separation of church and

state do when push comes to shove, when its multitudes demand, explicitly or

implicitly, their right to worship freely?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>“Whether diversity is a source of division or strength,” Eck concludes,

“is one of the crucial questions in the controversies of the public square as

racial, cultural, and religious differences are negotiated” (5).<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Because religious expression is so visible.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>“When a new Hindu temple is constructed, when an Islamic school

applies for permission to build, when a Sikh wearing a turban appears for a job

interview, or when a Muslim woman wearing a <u>hijab</u> goes to a grocery

store,” Eck observes, “the striking visibility of a religious culture

unfamiliar to many Americans may be the catalyst of suspicious and fearful

response” (7).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the language of

current criticism, WASP hegemony—and its racial, ethnic, and religious

prerogatives—fuels this suspicion and fear, potentially leading to hostility.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>This

is Eck’s larger point: “Incidents of violence and vandalism make clear that race

and religion are different yet inseparable markers of identity.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many attacks on religious institutions also

have racist overtones” (10-11)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For

instance, she continues, “the arson of a black church is not directed against

Christianity, but against the buildings that visibly represent the life of the

African-American community” (11).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In

short, religious strife in America is generally racially and ethnically

motivated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fortunately, Eck recounts,

there are “numerous … countervailing stories not of violence, but of growing

understanding and cooperation between and among religious communities in the

United States” despite the fact that this “new deliberate era of interreligious

relationship does not usually make it into the newspapers” (11).<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>What

should and does make it into newspapers occasionally are positive public

expressions at the highest levels which suggest that diversity is our

strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Eck points to the example of

Hillary Rodham Clinton receiving American Muslims at the White House in

1996.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The significance of the event

itself is amplified by the photographic icons that display a new image of what

America looks like: the American flag and the Great Seal of the Presidency

frame the First Lady receiving American Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>In a culture saturated with print media and television,” Eck

adds, hitting on the importance of rhetoric and imagery, “these iconic

representations convey, above all, the public record an extraordinary historic

occasion” (16).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, the horizon, to

gloss Angelou, does seem to be leaning forward.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Another

interesting essay, Robert Kiely’s “From Monticello to Graceland: Jefferson and

Elvis as American Icons,” steps back to examine the function of iconic

representation in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kiely asks,

is there anything that we, as Americans, irrespective of our differences, hold

as sacred?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He posits that America’s

lack of a “state religion” causes us “to transfer our need for a unifying

faith, [a] shareable reverence, onto the landscape or onto secular places and

especially buildings associated with persons or events that we can all claim as

our own” (208).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He does not suggest

that Graceland, the gaudy tribute to Elvis Presley, the late “King” of

rock-and-roll, has replaced the splendor of Jefferson’s Monticello; rather,

Kiely suggests per force how they exist side-by-side, each taking on their own

sacred character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Kiely puts it,

what’s remarkable about the American experience is that our sense of unity and

division simultaneously define what we view as sacred.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Mormon

Tabernacle in Salt Lake City can never compete with the Mississippi River or

the Empire State Building as American shrines,” Kiely concludes, “precisely

because they are denominational and therefore signs of our differences rather

than our unity” (208).<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>This

is Kiely’s fundamental point, then: there are those universal, traditional

elements of the sacred found when we revel in our denominational difference

while sitting in our churches, synagogues, and temples.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, there are those moments when we revel

in our sameness while standing before the majesty of, say, the Grand Canyon.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

collection’s concluding essay, Marjorie Garber’s “Two-Point Conversion,”

addresses the curious marriage in this country between sports and evangelical

Christianity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This piece is a must read

for liberal-minded, academic sports fans everywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>It has become a commonplace nowadays for athletes, when

interviewed after the big game in which they made the deciding play, to give

thanks to God for their victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The

logic of this strikes many as strange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Does God really favor one team over the other?<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>One player over another?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>It’s all a part of the phenomenon known as “sports evangelism,”

exemplified best, perhaps, in the person of former Green Bay Packer Reggie White

and his so-called God Squad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While

White’s popularity may seem to challenge WASP hegemony, it falls short.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, Garber muses, how well received

would Reggie White’s evangelism be if he was a Muslim, or if the Promise

Keepers promoted Judaism? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Ultimately,

Garber concludes, “The high visibility of evangelical and salvific Christianity

in sports, and its close ties with a competitive rhetoric of patriotism and

Americanism, suggest that this may be the moment to call for a time out on

proclamations of holiness in the huddle—time to rethink the troubling

implications of public prayer on the field and organized team prayers in the

locker room” (307).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She provides

numerous examples of just why such a separation of church and sports is

necessary.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

by The Reverend Dorothy A. Austin, Michael Eric Dyson, Barbara Claire Freeman,

Cheryl Townsend Gilkes, Rabbi Irving Greenberg, William R. Handley, Peter S.

Hawkins, Azizah al-Hibri, Janet R. Jakobsen &amp; Ann Pellegrini, David Lyle

Jeffrey, David Kennedy, Deborah E. Lipstadt, Stephen Prothero, and a Foreward

by Cornel West, complete the collection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>The interdisciplinary nature of the book only adds to its broad appeal.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Victor

E. Taylor’s <i>Para/Inquiry</i> moves in a different direction.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At first glance, given the book’s structure,

    <i>Para/Inquiry</i> reads like Roland Barthes’ <i>S/Z</i>, employing as it does

something like the <i>lexias</i> and <i> divagations</i> contained in Barthes’

inventive essay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like Barthes’ work,

this book forges new paths given its interdisciplinary lines of inquiry.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Taylor moves deftly from philosophy to

religion, art, and literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Divided

into eight chapters—framed by a ponderous opening titled “Posting” and a brief

glossary—the text attempts to push the traditional boundaries of how we

understand and articulate the sacred within the postmodern condition.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

task is formidable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, we live

more and more in the shadow, the “post-,” of those daunting nineteenth century

declarations about the death of God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of

course, the startling notion included in these provocative statements by Ralph

Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche is that we ourselves killed God.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took Harvard University several decades

until it warmed up to Emerson’s startling message to its 1838 divinity

graduates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His goal, like that of Walt

Whitman, was for individuals to become their own ministers, priests, and

rabbis, achieving a kind of religious and spiritual self-reliance.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Para/Inquiry</i> examines where we are

left theoretically in a world of multi-religious pluralism and in the wake of

the death of god and of the transcendent.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

outline of Jean-François Lyotard’s later philosophical project underlies much

of Taylor’s work, primarily Lyotard’s thesis regarding the inadequacy of

metanarratives, those stories that presumed to speak in a continuous and

comprehensive manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is exactly

what Lyotard was referring to when he declared “Let us wage a war on totality”

at the end of his essay “Answering the Question: What is Postmodernism?”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That essay echoes through Taylor’s book as a

whole, offering a complementary question: “What is the Postmodern sacred?”<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Defining

his terms in the first chapter, Taylor writes that “The sacred, a well-worn and

much abandoned concept today, is generally invoked as that archaic foundation

which has been lost or forfeited by collective humanity to a thoroughly

(post)modern secular world” (14).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Resisting nostalgia, he then adds, “The sacred, with its archaic

foundation, its promise, its secret, cannot be restored to its former

grandeur….”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, “it [the sacred]

must be substituted for, and that substitution is always non-transcendent,

inadequate, infinite and necessary” (15).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>For Taylor, this sacred substitution demands going beyond (<i>para</i>-)

the archaic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This makes his lines of

inquiry post-modern and decidedly non-linear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>“[T]he question which drives this writing,” Taylor makes clear at the

end of chapter one, is this: “What was inquiry before it found its rules?”

(17).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While this question may be

unanswerable, it is all the more valuable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>It demands that we think prior to foundations, transcendence, and

origins, all the while investigating their limits.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Chapters

two and three consider this exigency through numerous visual and narrative

artists, primarily Elihu Vedder and André Malraux.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Postmodern artists are key participants in parainquiry, Taylor

writes, because they “continually pay tribute to Nietzsche’s thought by

addressing the heterogeneity and ultimate inaccessibility of origin and end”

(22).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Again, Lyotard circulates through

the text, specifically his references to the unpresentable.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“[I]t is our business not to supply

reality,” Lyotard writes in “What is Postmodernism?”, “but to invent allusions

to the conceivable which cannot be represented.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>By the end of chapter four, referencing the religious philosopher

Marcel Eliade, Taylor concludes that “The sacred power, the ultimate … can

reside … anywhere” (69).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This

reformulation of the sacred as <i>parasacred</i> is key in Taylor’s book,

attentive as it is to allusive and ubiquitous character of the unpresentable.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Postmodern

thought is often criticized as being apolitical and nihilistic.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While a critic like Bill Readings has worked

to dispel this myth in the example of Lyotard, Taylor implicitly addresses such

a critique through his references to the Shoa in chapter five.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Can or should any grand narrative be able to

account for this tragic event that Paul Celan declared to have caused the end

of poetic discourse?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consider the

recent and remarkable comments by the Pope regarding Catholic complicity in the

holocaust, altering as it did the continuity of one of Christianity’s grandest

grand narratives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Did those comments

gesture toward the parasacred?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Certainly it seemed a more responsible acknowledgement, the result, no

doubt of re-thinking the origins and ends of Catholic theology.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Referencing Lyotard once again, it resisted

supplying a flawed reality, preferring acknowledgment of what was

inexcusable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Refiguring typical notions

of the sacred is ultimately more ethical, Taylor suggests, adding a decidedly

political bite to what Lyotard called “our business.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>After all, “anything (history, deity, class, race, gender,

sexuality, etc.) can produce a grand narrative which can account, with equal

proficiency, for the continuity of all events.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Or, I would add, a grand narrative which remains silent.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What must be recognized, however, is that “<i>nothing</i>

can account for discontinuity” (78).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Parainquiry attends to such discontinuity.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>“The prefix <i>para</i>,” Taylor says in reference to the key

term in his book’s title, “indicates this complexity, this beyond, this extra,

this alteration of the continuous line found in things such as subjectivity,

ethics, politics, experience” (79). <o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>But

is the parasacred always already unreachable, unpresentable?<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If so, is death the best reference we have

to it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other words, how do we get

“there”—to the beyond of the <i>para</i>—from here?<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

book’s ante-penultimate chapter is a meditation on the link that death has with

the parasacred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Consecrated grounds,”

such as cemeteries Taylor suggests, “represent, figure, signify, and forge the

links between the ‘here’ and the ‘there,’ life and death” (93).<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, “The grave”—as

aporia—“illustrate[s] this tension between the here and the there.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>… The here and there, from either direction,

meet at the site of the grave” (96).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>They key phrase is “illustrate[s] this tension.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Death only marks a meeting point between the

two, not a full and complete narrative about their relation.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is why grave markers, whether sacred or

profane, with images of folded hands, saints, or football players and cars, are

parasacred, Taylor says later in chapter six, because “they defer the

totalization of the ultimate” (101).<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>The

penultimate chapter continues this thought, musing on the way in which

seemingly “irreverent/iconoclastic” markers now commonly replace specifically

religious ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“If any and all

representations are, in the end, inadequate, what makes a football player or

fisherman less appropriate than Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, or John the

Baptist?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In relation one to the other,

“the irreverent/iconoclastic” marker, Taylor writes, “is more pious than the

overtly religious as it parodies and speaks directly of the inadequacy of the representation(s)

of the aporia” of death (110).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because “death exceeds all

gestures toward completion” (110).<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Ultimately,

we have no complete, adequate marker today to lead everyone from here to

there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Postmodernism, Taylor suggests

in his last chapter, is still itself just one more inadequate marker.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, “One cannot remove a foundation

in the name of anti-foundationalism only to re-instate a foundation that is

more pleasing to an array of ideological formations or neurotic styles.”<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, “Parainquiry in the age of

postmodernism leaves us unable to think and live comfortably, with either the

simple presence or absence of an ultimate concern” (117).<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Is

that good or bad?<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>

  <li><span style='mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt'>Rainer

Maria Rilke, that great spirit of existential pondering, offered a comment

about questions and answers in “Letters to a Young Poet” nearly one-hundred

years ago that I think is relevant here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>“[T]ry to love <i>the questions themselves</i>,” Rilke says, and “Do not

seek the answers, that cannot be given you because you would not be able to

live them.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What the ensuing culture

wars have taught us is clear: conservatives like the answers, especially

because they have such a clear sense of what the right answers are.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course, liberal-minded and postmodern

folks are just the opposite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They, like

Rilke, prefer the questions, finding in their postmodern sensibility that the

center really cannot hold, and that things have and will always fall apart.<o:p></o:p></span><P></LI>
