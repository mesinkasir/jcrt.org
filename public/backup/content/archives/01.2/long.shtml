Eliade frustrates, irritates, and leads anthropologists and other social
scientists to fits of anger, more than his <i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i>
(<i>Traité d’histoire des Religions</i>).<a href="#fn1" name="n1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a>
It reminds them too much of Frazer’s <i>Golden Bough</i> or of lesser popular
texts of exotic oddities that purport to describe the customs of primitive
cultures.  In a milder critical vein, it represents the kind of work that
cannot, at least, should not be undertaken, for it appears to rest on a naiveté
lacking in scholarly sophistication regarding the relationship of religion, behaviour,
and social structure.</p>

<li>But given these kinds of
criticisms and critics, I doubt if many of his most vociferous critics have
ever read the work in its entirety or George Dumezil’s introduction to the
original French edition.  From either of
these readings one would learn that Eliade is presenting a systematic text,
attempting to address the issue of religion as a specific mode of being.  Now it may be that several modern
disciplines have already decided that the religious life does not exist and
this decision has lead them to fashion methodologies that reduce the forms of
religion to those human dimensions more consonant with the ideologies and
existential situations of a non-religious modernity.  Much has and can be learned from such approaches, but they need
not express an imperialism of method for it is equally the situation of
modernity that has called forth the need for, and hermeneutical procedures that
seek, an interpretation of the historical range of human expressions in their
specificity and integrity, whether in art, linguistics, geography, etc.<P></li>

<li>Along with Rudolf Otto’s <i>The
Idea of the Holy</i>, Eliade’s <i>Patterns in Comparative</i> <i>Religion</i>
is a most fruitful text for raising the issue of religious epistemology.  In this text Eliade attempts to account for
the inner structure of the consciousness of <i>homo religiosus</i> from an
examination of the sacred symbols of archaic cultures.  In this regard, the text begins from the
other side of Otto, who attempted first to give us an account of consciousness
and then to show how it expresses itself through religious forms.  Eliade’s work shows how the forms of matter,
(nature) evoke modes of consciousness and experience (hierophanies).<p></li>

<LI>Let us begin with a cursory
examination of the Table of Contents of <i>Patterns. </i>The text consists of thirteen
chapters.  The first chapter is entitled
"Approximations: the Structure and Morphology of the Sacred." In this
chapter he sets forth the
problematical nature of his undertaking and delineates the language for talking
about religion; the language of the sacred and the profane are the most general
linguistic categories, while the notion of hierophanies is the language of manifestation,
of showing.  Allusions are also made to
those approaches to the religious which are predicated on the notion of <i>homo</i>
<i>socius</i> as both a specific and general category and how his work differs
from this position.  The next three
chapters are entitled, respectively, “The Sky and Sky Gods,” “The Sun and
Sun-Worship,” and “The Moon and its Mystique.” In these three chapters we are confronted with those religious
experiences and expressions related to celestial phenomenon.<p></LI>

<LI>Two chapters follow, one
devoted to “The Water and Water Symbolism,” and the other entitled “Sacred
Stones: Ephiphanies, Signs and Forms.” So now, after the celestial forms we are dealing with terrestial
forms.  The next three chapters, “The
Earth, Woman and Fertility,” “Vegetation Rites and Symbols of Regeneration,”
“Agriculture and Fertility Rites,” are all related to human intervention upon
the order of nature as a specific form of sacrality.  The next two chapters, chapters ten and eleven, bear the titles
“Sacred Places: Temple, Palace, ‘Centre of the World’,” and “Sacred Time and
the Myth of the Eternal Renewal.” The
last two chapters are given over to “The Morphology and Function of Myths” and
“The Structure of Symbols."<p></LI>

<LI>I have given this outline of
the Table of Contents in order to call attention to the systematic order of the text. 
The author is attempting to show
the correlation between the experience, transformation and celebration of
nature, and the linguistic and symbolic modes for expressing these actions and
experiences.  This procedure enables us
to understand the archaic mode of consciousness, and in addition to this, we
are presented with a “generative logic” of symbolic religious forms.
Wherein do we find this logic?<p></LI>

<LI><span>Let
me proceed by calling your attention to a series of statements that occur
rather early in the chapters on the Sky, Moon, Water, and Stone. First the Sky:</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>The sky shows itself as it really is:
infinite, transcendent. The vault of
heaven is, more than anything else, “something quite apart” from the tiny thing
that is man and his span of life. The
symbolism of its transcendence derives from the simple realization of its
infinite height. . . . All this derives
from simply contemplating the sky; but it would be a mistake to see it as a
logical, rational process. The
transcendental quality of height or the supraterrestial, the infinite, is
revealed to man all at once, to his intellect as to his soul as a whole. . . Let me repeat: even before any religious
values have been set upon the sky it reveals its transcendence, power and
changelessness simply by being there. It exists because it is high, infinite, immovable,
powerful.<a href="#fn2" name="n2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>
<LI><span>The analagous statement for the moon is as
follows:</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>The sun is always the same, always itself,
never in any sense “becoming”. The
moon, on the other hand, is a body which waxes, wanes and disappears, a body
whose existence is subject to the universal law of becoming, of birth and death.
The moon, like man, has a career,
involving tragedy, for its failing, like man’s, ends in death.<sup><a href="#fn3" name="n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>
<LI>Now for water:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>To state the case in brief, water symbolizes
the whole of potentiality: it is <i>fons</i> <i>et</i> <i>origo</i>, the source
of all possible existence. . . . Principle of what is formless and potential, basis
of every cosmic manifestation, container of all seeds, water symbolizes the
primal substance from which all forms come and to which they will return either
by their own regression or in a cataclysm.<sup><a href="#fn4" name="n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>
<LI><span>And finally for stones:</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>The hardness, ruggedness, and permanence of
matter was in itself a hierophany in the religious consciousness of the
primitive. And nothing was more direct
and autonomous in the completeness of its strength, nothing more noble or more
awe-inspiring, than a majestic rock, or a boldly-standing block of granite. Above all, stone <i>is</i>.
It always remains itself, and exists of
itself; and, more important still, it strikes. . . . Rock shows him something that
transcends the precariousness of his humanity; an absolute mode of being. Its strength, its motionlessness, its size
and its strange outlines are none of them human; they indicate the presence of
something that fascinates, terrifies, attracts and threatens, all at once. In its grandeur, its hardness, its shape and
its colour, man is faced with a reality and a force that belong to some world
other than the profane world of which he is himself a part.<sup><a href="#fn5" name="n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>
<LI>In
all of these statements Eliade is speaking of a primary and primordial
intuition of matter. In other words, he
is approaching the issue of religious experiences in a twofold manner. The specific intuition of human
consciousness is always correlated with an <i>a priori</i> form of the
world. It is the universality of matter
itself in all of its several forms, rather than simply the inner working of the
human consciousness epistemologically or psychologically which is the source of
the religious consciousness. Mind and
phenomena go together. The Kantian
epistemology which has ruled out knowledge of “things-in-themselves,” leaves us
with the abstractions of consciousness proceeding from the vague intuitions and
traces of the things-in-themselves, those things we can never know. For Eliade the very structure of the religious
consciousness is predicated on a form of the world which is present as a
concrete form of matter.<p></LI>

<LI><span>While
it is the case that the religious consciousness is always capable of
recognizing the distinction between the sacred and the profane, this is merely
the most general formulation of the religious dialectic. Every religious person and community
recognizes this distinction in a precise and specific manner, and the archaic
source of these specificities is the <i>a</i> <i>priori</i> <i>concrete</i>
forms of matter. </span><p></LI>

<LI><span>If
we take note of it, we can see a logical or symbological relationship portrayed
in the text. The chapter on the sky and
sky-gods has a primary status for it is the correlation of the meaning of the
sky with the very opening of consciousness. The sky itself as a religious intuition, before even gods are spoken of
as inhabiting the sky, reveals transcendence. In this sense it is a symbol of
orientation. Its height and its vault place the human within a proper
realm--the situation of finitude in the face of the exaltation of the
transcendent starry and shining vault of heaven. Consciousness itself is the most specific correlate of this
grandeur of the sky; we are situated as humans in this manner.
</span><p></LI>

<LI><span>If
you will note, I did not include any of Eliade’s statements regarding the
imagination of matter from his chapter on the sun and sun-worship. There was a good reason for
this. There is no such statement regarding the
imaginary meaning of the sun. The sun
is thus ambiguous within the structure of the text. Let me give some of the reasons for this
ambiguity. First of all, it is Eliade’s belief that sun
hierophanies in their most developed forms are always tied up with “historical
destinies,” in cultures where history in on the march. Secondly, from the time of Aristotle onward
the intellectual symbolism of the sun has, in Eliade’s words, “blunted our
receptiveness toward the <i>totality</i> of sun hierophanies.”<sup><a href="#fn6" name="n6">6</a></sup> And
then again in the chapter on the moon and its mystique, he states that, “The
sun is always the same, always itself, never in any sense ‘becoming’.”<sup><a href="#fn7" name="n7">7</a></sup>
Thus, though the sun is celestial in its form, it does not allow for that mode
of becoming which Eliade wishes to correlate with the symbology of the human
consciousness. The sun has no rhythms,
it has no becoming; it refers to the clear and the distinct, the rational and
intellectual. </span><p></LI>

<LI><span>Now
Eliade is willing to speculate that at one time or another there may have been
another meaning to the sun and its symbolism, but from the data at hand the sun
has been branded with those meanings which emphasize a break, critique and
tension with the other primordial symbols.  The sun, as some malevolent symbol,
is accused of being the cause of a “fall” of consciousness into the rational
and practical. “This passage,” he says:</span>

<blockquote>

<p><span>from “creator” to “fecundator”, this slipping
of the omnipotence, transcendence and impassiveness of the sky into the
dynamism, intensity and drama of the atmospheric, fertilizing, vegetation
figures, is not without significance. It makes quite clear that one of the main factors in the lowering of
people’s conceptions of God, most obvious in agricultural societies, is the
more and more all-embracing importance of vital values and of “Life” in the
outlook of economic man.<sup><a href="#fn8" name="n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>
<LI>Throughout this chapter the
ambivalent nature of the sun comes into play. The sun thus symbolizes in religious form the very ambivalence of life
and possibility of <i>homo</i> <i>religiosus</i>; the basic dialectic between
the religious being and that form of rationalism that is brought into the
religious arena through the symbolism of the sun.<p></LI>

<LI><span>It
is appropriate at this point to mention another primary imaginative religious
structure that is initially described in some of the same language he has used
in relationship to the sun. I speak of
the stone. Like the sun, the stone
always remains itself; it is motionless and unchangeable. While the stone seems similar to the sun, it
escapes the negative ambiguity of the sun because of its ability to enter into
other symbolic relationships--relationships which keep alive a rhythmic
dialectic that prevents a premature rationalization. Both in the chapter devoted to stones and in chapter thirteen on
the structure of symbols, a great deal of attention is given to the relational
character of stone symbolism. Stones
are symbols of fertility, burial sites, omphalos; they are able to hold
together paradoxical meanings. The
infantilization of stone symbolism through degeneration or rationalism is even
quite interesting. </span><p></LI>

<LI><span>It
is strange that Eliade gives very little significance to stone tools. Here again we have a case in which the
modification of the material form signifies the human presence. Again in the very act of making stone tools,
the striking of one stone against another, an obdurate oppugnancy and internal
dialectical rhythm and flexibility is established which allows the symbolism of
stone to escape the tyranny of sheer practical activity on the one hand and
simple rationalization on the other. </span><p></LI>

<LI><span>From
our initial symbols, we have yet to speak of moon and water symbols. It is clear from the enthusiasm which is
present in these chapters that along with the sky, these imaginary modes of
matter hold exemplary places in Eliade’s thought. The waxing and waning of the moon is the archetype of <i>real</i> <i>human</i> time. This time, he explains,
should be distinguished from astronomical time (rationalized time) which comes
later. Here we are dealing with time in
the concrete sense. The rhythms of the
moon measure and synthesize the various modes of <i>concrete</i>  time. </span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>Thus, for instance, from the
earliest times, certainly since the Neolithic Age, with the discovery of
agriculture, the same symbolism has linked together the moon, the sea waters,
rain, the fertility of women and of animals, plant life, man’s destiny after
death and the ceremonies of initiation. The mental syntheses made possible by the realization of the moon’s
rhythms connect and unify very varied realities; their structural symmetries
and the analogies in their workings could never have been seen had not
“primitive” man intuitively perceived the moon’s law of periodic change, as he
did very early on.<sup><a href="#fn9" name="n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>
<LI><span>When
we look at the chapter on the moon carefully we perceive that in many respects
it is a recapitulation of much that has gone on before and a forward to much
that will follow. There are sections on
“the moon and water,” “initiation,” “women,” “fertility,” “death,”
etc. </span><p></LI>

<LI><span>It
is clear for Eliade that as far as celestial symbolism is concerned, the moon
is the symbol <i>par</i> <i>excellence</i> of the human condition. </span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Becoming” is the lunar
order of things. Whether it is taken as
the playing-out of a drama (the birth, fulness and disappearance of the moon),
or given the sense of a “division” or “enumeration”, or intuitively seen as the
“hempen rope” of which the threads of fate are woven, depends, of course, on
the myth-making and theorizing powers of individual tribes. . . . But the formulae
used to express that “becoming” are heterogeneous on the surface only. The moon “divides”, “spins”, and “measures”;
or feeds, makes fruitful, and blesses. . . .<sup><a href="#fn10" name="n10">10</a></sup></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>

<LI><span>The moon is equally the
source of symbols of integration, the <i>coincidence</i> <i>oppositorum</i> of the
paradox of the lunar and solar modalities into a unity. </span><p>

<LI><span>Water,
much as in the case of the moon, is a synthesizing symbol. It is the source of all things and the
dissolution of all forms, but it has no form in itself, thus its adaptability
to various modalities reveals its multivalent character. </span><p>

<LI><span>The
next section of chapters reveals how these primary symbols find rhythmic or
liturgical meanings in existential modes. They show how the religious consciousness revalorizes meanings so that
action and practical activity do not serve to demythologize the primary
intuitions of matter (the hierophanies). </span><p>

<LI><span>Allow
me to summarize what I have tried to do in this analysis:</span></p>

<ol>
  <li><span>Reveal
the systematic nature of <i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i>. </span></li>
  <li><span>Show
how Eliade reveals the structure of archaic consciousness. </span></li>
  <li><span>Emphasize
the meaning of matter as a constituitive ingredient in the formulation of the
archaic consciousness in Eliade’s thought. </span></li>
</ol>
<P>
<LI><span>Since
I have emphasized the imagination of matter in Eliade’s work I should like to
proceed to a distinction between <i>homo</i> <i>faber</i> and <i>homo</i> <i>religiosus</i>. 
V.  Gordon Childe coined the term “neolithic revolution” to refer to the radical
change made possible for human cultures with the discovery of agriculture and
the domestication of plants. This
“revolution” formed the basis for citied traditions in various parts of the
world, traditions with their notae of intensified demography, division of labor,
surplus commodities, written language, historical destinies, etc., became the
norm for the human condition. Childe’s
researches were consonant with the evolutionary, progressivistic historical
notions prevalent since the beginnings of the human sciences in the late
nineteenth century. Investigations
tended to assume that early human cultures were characterized by rudimentary
intellectual and creative capacities or were overwhelmed by irrational and
illogical modes of thought. “How
natives think” or the evolutionary trajectory from primitive to scientific
thought obsessed many investigators. </span><p>

<LI><span>It
is now, however, a commonplace to speak of the creativity of early human
cultures. Marxists and neo-Marxist
thinkers are increasingly concerned with the problem of origins, especially the
origins of the human as <i>homo</i> <i>faber</i>. It is clear to the sophisticated Marxist that Marx inherited many
of the current ideas of historical and economic processes <i>en vogue</i>
during his time. The notion of the four
stages of economic and political development in human history forms a common
context for Adam Smith, the Scottish moralist, and Karl Marx. (See Ronald Meeks’ <i>Social Science and the
Ignoble Savage</i>. Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1976.)</span><p>

<LI><span>In
the works of Karel Kosik, <i>Dialectics of the Concrete</i> and Tran Duc Thao,
“Due Geste de L’Index a L’Image Typique,”<sup><a href="#fn11" name="n11">11</a></sup> the issue of the
originary and imaginary gesture of <i>homo faber</i> as the human is raised. 
Thao begins with a
statement describing Marx’s analysis of work. Three elements are present: 1) the specific activity of the human being;
2) the object on which the activity acts; and 3) the means by which it acts. He asserts that the activity of
large anthropoids in using a stick to reach an object is not a genuine act of
work, for only motion is inserted between the natural organs and the material
acted upon. The object of need and the
activity of motion are identical. </span><p>

<LI><span>An
authentic act of work occurs when, through some second instrument, the direct
manipulation of matter is transformed into an act of work. The act of production implies that the
worker is guided by an ideal image of a typical form and the presence of such a
form on the object which enables the worker to realize that it is a product of
the human hand. It is this ideal image
that constitutes a common locus between <i>homo</i> <i>faber</i> and <i>homo</i>
<i>religiosus</i>. The ideal image of
nature for the Marxist is a concrete appearance of matter which can lead to a
totalization of the authentic human community based upon the modes of production.
This is the appearance of <i>homo</i>
<i>aeconomicus</i> through the modality of <i>homo</i> <i>faber</i>. </span><p>

<LI><span>It
is at the level of the ideal image that the imaginary intermediate, the tension
between <i>homo</i> <i>faber </i>and <i>homo religiosus</i>  appears. The proper understanding of the totalization
of the originary gesture is the issue at stake. </span><p>

<LI><span>Karl
Kosik delineates three modes of the totalization of the concrete:</span>

<ol>
  <li><span>An
empty totality that lacks reflection and determination of individual movements
and analysis. Empty totality excludes
reflection, i. e., the appropriation of reality as individual moments and the
activity of analytical reason. </span></li>
  <li><span>An
abstract totality which formalizes the whole as opposed to its parts and
ascribes a higher reality to hypostasized tendencies. Totality thus concerned is without genesis and
    development. Devoid of process it is a closed whole. </span></li>
  <li><span>A
bad totality, in which the real subject has been replaced by a mythologized
    subject. </span></li>
</ol>
<P>

<LI><span>Surrounding
all forms of totalization is care (<i>Sorge</i>).  In Kosik’s words, “The primary and
elementary mode in which economics exists for man is care. . . . Care is the practical involvement of the
individual in a tangle of social relations conceived from the position of his
personal, individual, subjective involvement.”<sup><a href="#fn12" name="n12">12</a></sup> Or again, “Care is
1) the entanglement of the social individual in a system of social relations on
the basis of his involvement and utilitarian praxis; 2) the activity of this
individual which in the elementary form appears as caring and procuring; 3) the
subject of activity (of procuring and caring) which appears as lack of
differentiation and anonymity.”<sup><a href="#fn13" name="n13">13</a></sup></span><p>

<LI><span>Care
enables the person to develop a meaning of nature that transcends its role and
significance as a workshop that provides raw materials for human productivity. Such a reduction of
nature would from Kosik’s perspective constitute “the loss of nature as something
created neither by man nor by anyone else, as something eternal and uncreated,
and would be coupled with the loss of the awareness that man is a part of a
greater whole: compared with it, man becomes aware both of its smallness and of
his greatness.”<sup><a href="#fn14" name="n14">14</a></sup></span><p>

<LI><span>Kosik’s
use of care is similar to the meaning Victor Turner has described as the oretic
meaning of the symbol or Martin Buber’s meaning of the I-Thou relationship.<sup><a href="#fn15" name="n15">15</a></sup>
Though care is necessary to save the uniqueness of the human and the proper
relationship to an authentic meaning of nature, care itself, because it favors
the future and lives in anticipation, may become the basis for a repudiation of
concrete existence in the future in favor of a fetishized future and a
fetishized temporality.<sup><a href="#fn16" name="n16">16</a></sup></span><p>

<LI><span>The
way out of this temptation to fetishism is through the recognition of the full
meaning of <i>homo</i> <i>aeconomicus</i> as the full materialistic context for
the human mode of being. Such a context
establishes the locus for the totalization of the human as a concrete socio-historical
being and allows for the full release of personal and social valuations. </span><p>

<LI><span>The
problematic of a history of matter as a totalization of religious and sacred
meaning is undertaken by Mircea Eliade in a precise manner in his <i>The Forge
and the Crucible</i> (originally published as <i>Forgerons et Alchimistes </i>.<sup><a href="#fn17" name="n17">17</a></sup>
General themes related to this issue are found in almost all of his works,
especially in <i>Histoire des croyance et des idées religieuses</i>.<sup><a href="#fn18" name="n18">18</a></sup></span><p>

<LI><span>Mircea
Eliade’s work is not conceived as a counter to or refutation of the Marxist
tradition; while aware of the Marxist ideology as one of the elements of
contemporary thought, Eliade’s studies are a work of creative scholarship
possessing their own integrity. However,
precisely because his work is a hermeneutical endeavor, he confronts the same
latent and manifest problems of the Marxist and he is well aware of the Marxist
resolutions. </span><p>

<LI><span>In
<i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i>, he alludes to the origins of <i>homo</i>
<i>aeconomicus</i>, when he says,</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>. . . </span><span>the supreme divinities of
the sky are constantly pushed to the periphery of the religious life where they
are almost ignored; other sacred forces, nearer to man, more accessible to his
daily experience, more useful to him, fill the leading role.<sup><a href="#fn19" name="n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span>. . . </span><span>it is a popular
expression of the idea of the transcendence and passivity of the Supreme Being,
too far removed from man to satisfy his innumerable religious, economic vital
needs.<sup><a href="#fn20" name="n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>

<LI><span>The
stylistic mood of <i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i> is one of passivity,
for Eliade is attempting to show how human existence is dominated by the
archetypes, the initial perceptions of sacred forms. These archetypes may form a symbological pattern within a
particular culture or within the history of humankind itself. But even when the historical dimension is
referred to in <i>Patterns</i>, it is a “history” of the archetypes or it is a
history that is learned from the archetypal forms revealed in human activity
with matter. </span><p>

<LI><span>If
we locate the beginnings of human history where it is conventionally understood
to have begun, in the neolithic period with the domestication of plants and
animals, this period of time, for Eliade, represents a change but not a clear
and clean break with the archetypal patterning of human life. What is decidely new here is the active
intervention of human communities in the world of nature:</span>

<blockquote>

<p><span>. . . </span><span>agriculture displays the mystery of the
rebirth of plant life in a more dramatic manner. In the rites and skills of farming man is <i>intervening actively</i>;
plant life and the sacred forces of the plant world are no longer something
outside him; he takes part by using and fostering them.<sup><a href="#fn21" name="n21">21</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></LI>

<LI><span>In
this intervention, a new structure of the sacred appears; first there is the
identification of the former with the powers revealed in the life of the plant--a new space and time and a more abundant form of life. A more optimistic view of life comes into
being, for death is established as no more than a provisional change in the
human mode of being. </span><p>

<LI><span>But
this intervention is equally the temptation not only to abandon other
archetypes, e. g., the sky and sky deities and the entire range of the
“archetypes of passivity.” The
temptation for an autonomous existence beyond the world of archetypes comes
into being at this moment. The new time
and space revealed in the hierophanies of agriculture and the ability of the
human community to make use of and control these processes establishes a new
possibility for human relationships with matter and the meaning of totalization
of a form of nature thus symbolizing a total form of human existence. Agriculture is the point at which <i>homo</i>
<i>religiosus </i>,<i>homo</i> <i>faber</i>, and <i>homo</i> <i>aeconomicus</i> converge. </span><p>

<LI><span>For
those who see this amalgam of human dimensions integrated either by <i>homo
faber</i> or <i>homo aeconomicus</i>, the subsequent history of humanity with
its citied traditions, intensification of agriculture and the development of
technologies that allow for progressive intervention of the human community
into nature, this historical “ascent of man” leaves the horizon of archetypes
and hierophanies far behind. </span><p>

<LI><span>Now
a history of the human mode of being as <i>homo</i> <i>aeconomicus</i> might be
contemplated on this basis, but a history as <i>homo</i> <i>religosus</i> or <i>homo</i>
<i>faber</i> cannot be understood from this point of view without extreme
reductionism and selective distortion. </span><p>

<LI><span>Eliade
insists that human work and the imagination of the reality of matter has never
totally obliterated the fact that the human is also a “technician of the
sacred.” As Tran Duc Thao pointed out
in his definition of work, the worker is guided by the ideal image of a typical
(archetypal) form and it is the presence of this form on the object that
enables the worker to realize that his production is the work of the human hand. For Eliade, this ideal image or
typical form is the imagination of the sacred in matter, and because it is the
imagination of the sacred, the gods (sacrality) and the humans are co-creators. </span><p>

<LI><span>The
basic human discoveries about matter were made by archaic societies. That is to say that the discovery of
agriculture, the domestication of plants, the control of fire--all these
techniques that form the basis of all citied traditions were accomplished by <i>homo</i> <i>faber</i>
are in an archaic mode. </span><p>

<LI><span>The
magical experience of the world, or in Eliade’s terms, the experience of the
world as cosmos, implied the sacredness of the world, and this in turn meant
that knowledge of these techniques was a mystery and their transmission
constituted an initiation. </span><p>

<li><span>In
<i>The Forge and the Crucible</i>, Eliade understakes an analysis of alchemy--a technique present in the traditional citied traditions, but forming a
continuity with archaic metallurgy. Metallurgy is that technique that combines <i>homo</i> <i>faber</i> and <i>homo</i>
<i>religiosus</i>. </span>

<blockquote>

<p><span>Mineral substances shared in the sacredness
attaching to the Earth-Mother. Very
early on we are confronted with the notion that ores ‘grow’ in the belly of the
earth after the manner of embroyos. Metallurgy thus takes on the character of
obstetrics. Miner and metal-worker intervene in the
unfolding of subterranean embryology:they accelerate the rhythm of the growth
of ores, they collaborate in the work of Nature and assist it to give birth
more rapidly. In a word, man, with his
various techniques, gradually takes the place of Time: his labours replace the
work of Time. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></li>
<li><span>To collaborate in the work
of Nature, to help her to produce at an ever-increasing tempo, to change the
modalities of matter--here, in our view, lies one of the key sources of alchemical
ideology.<sup><a href="#fn22" name="n22">22</a></sup></span><p></li>

<li>Alchemy
as a specific technique is a practice of “historical cultures.” The appearance of this technique within
these cultures points to the perenniality of <i>homo</i> <i>religiosus</i>. Alchemy is not simply a repetition of older
archaic modes of metallurgy, nor is it an embryonic or proto-chemistry. It is rather the rediscovery of the religious imagination of matter on the
historical plane. Eliade places this
discovery within the same context as husbandry. </span>

<blockquote>

<p><span>From a certain point of
view, man, even the most primitive, has always been a ‘historic being’ by
reason of the fact that he was conditioned by the ideology, sociology and
economy peculiar to his tradition. But
I do not wish to speak of this historicity of man as a man, or as a being
conditioned by temporality and culture, but of a more recent and infinitely
more complex phenomenon, namely, the enforced involvement of entire humanity in
events taking place in a few restricted regions of the globe. This is what happened after the discovery of
agriculture and especially after the crystalization of the earliest urban
civilizations in the ancient Near East. From that moment all human culture, however strange and remote, was
doomed to undergo the consequences of the historic events which were taking
place at the ‘centre’. These
consequences sometimes became manifest thousands of years later, but they could
not in any way be avoided; they were part of the historic fatality. With the discovery of husbandry it is
possible to say that man was destined to become an agricultural being or at any
rate to suffer the influences of all subsequent discoveries and innovations
which agriculture made possible: domestication of animals, urban civilization,
miliary organization, empire, imperialism, mass wars, etc. In other words, all mankind became involved
in the activities of some of its members. Thus, from this time on--parallel with the rise of the first urban
civilizations in the Near East--it is possible to speak of history in the full
sense of the term, that is, of universal modifications effected by the creative
will of certain societies (more precisely, of privileged elements in those
societies).<sup><a href="#fn23" name="n23">23</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>The
alchemists through magico-religious techniques attempted the transmutation of
base metals into gold. One errs, in
Eliade’s view, if alchemists are seen as mere gold-seekers or counterfeiters. They had probably
discovered and/or retained an older conception of the Earth-Mother, bearer of
embryos. Above all it was the
experimental discovery of the </span>

<blockquote>

<p><span>living substance, such as it was felt by the
artisans, which must have played the decisive role. Indeed it is the conception of a complex and dramatic Life of
Matter which constitutes the originality of alchemy as opposed to classical
Greek science. One is entitled to
suppose that the experience of dramatic life was made possible by the knowledge
of Graeco-oriental mysteries.<sup><a href="#fn24" name="n24">24</a></sup></span></p>

</blockquote>
<P></li>
<li><span>In
alchemy the life of matter is manifested not as ‘vital’ hierophanies, as it was
for archaic cultures, but it acquires a spiritual dimension; it takes on the
initiatory significance of drama and suffering which can culminate in freedom,
illumination, transmutation. </span><p></li>

<li><span>While
Eliade admits the significance of technological creativity and the meaning of
the historicity of the human community as an arena of religious significance, <i>homo
religiosus </i>implies a structure of
perception of the world. This structure
is the religious experience. It does
not mean a reversion to a past for it is always in the context of a present
situation, and the temporal context of the present provides the modes of
expression and meaning. At least since
the Neolithic period the relationship of the human community to the material
world has undergone dramatic transformations. The inner structure of matter as the basis for cosmic order changes with
every technological praxis. Through
these changes life and integrity of matter becames obscured, infantilized,
trivialized and disenchanted.  There
is nevertheless the possibility for the rediscovery of the life of matter as a
religious phenomenon--an equal and sometimes alternate structure in the face
of the dehumanizing and terroristic meaning of history. </span></li>

<B>Charles H. Long</B>, prior to his retirement in September, 1996, held
faculty positions as professor of history of religions at the University
of Chicago, William Rand Kenan, Jr. professor of history of religions at
the
University of North Carolina, professor of history of religion at Duke University, Jeannette K. Watson professor of history of religions at Syracuse University. At the University of Chicago he studied with the pioneer of the development of the history of religions in the United States, Professor Joachim Wach.  He eventually joined with Professors Mircea Eliade and Joseph Kitagawa in establishing the international scholarly journal, <I>History of Religions</I>.  This journal and the discipline as formed at Chicago were major forces in the establishment of the study of religion in the United States.  He has a unique perspective from which to speak of the general meaning of religion in history and culture, and specifically about African religions in the Atlantic world.   He, along with a group of his colleagues at the University of Chicago, established the first curriculum for the study of religion in the College of the University of Chicago.  He was a member and subsequently served as chair of the history of religions field and the Committee on African Studies, respectively, at the University of Chicago.  He has been involved in the training of three generations of scholars in religion and African American studies. His books include <I>Alpha</I>, <I>The Myths of Creation</I>, <I>The History of Religions</I>, (ed. with Joseph Kitagawa, 1967), <I>Myth, and Symbols, Essays in Honor of Mircea Eliade</I>, (ed. with J. Kitagawa, 1969); and <I>Significations: Signs, Symbols, and Images, in the Interpretation of Religion </I> (1986).  At present time his work is devoted to the meaning of religion in the formation of the Atlantic world.  This is the world of the African slave trade and the basis for the formation of the "New World."  Strangely enough, most interpretations of the Atlantic world are hermeneutically silent concerning the African diaspora.  Long relocates the issue of religion within the structures of the Atlantic formation. This cultural geographical formation of the New World System and the Atlantic World enables us to understand religion and African American religions as distinctively new and creative meaning of the modern world.
