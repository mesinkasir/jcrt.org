**PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION AND THE THEORY OF RELIGION**

_The Vol. 18, No. 3 (Fall 2019) edition of the Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory features six essays by known and emerging scholars in the field on how the philosophy of religion contributes theoretically and methodologically to the theory of religion. These essays were originally part of a special session at the American Academy of Religion annual meeting._  _While this question is often taken up by philosophers and theorists working outside of religious studies, this set of essays offers compelling answers from thinkers who identify as scholars of religion above all else._
