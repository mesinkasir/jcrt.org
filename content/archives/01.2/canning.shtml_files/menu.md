**Dear Patron:**  
  
The Wayback Machine is fighting for universal access to quality information. The Internet Archive, which runs this project, relies on donations to help us keep the record straight. We'd be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially.  
  
We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute this Thursday, we promise it will be put to good use. Our resources are crucial for knowledge lovers everywhere—so if you find all these bits and bytes useful, **please pitch in.**

We keep the record straight by preserving government websites, news articles, historical data, and more. If you find our archive useful, **please pitch in.**
