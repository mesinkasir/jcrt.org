The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory (JCRT) is a peer-reviewed journal devoted to both disciplinary and interdisciplinary scholarship of a cutting-edge nature that deals broadly with the phenomenon of religious and cultural theory.  Subfields include, but are not limited to, philosophical and cultural theory, theological studies, postcolonial and globalization theory, religious studies, literary theory, cultural studies, ethnic, area, and gender studies, communications, semiotics, and linguistics. 

The JCRT is free of charge, and is published two to three times a year.

Current institutional sponsors are the University of Denver and South Dakota State University. For more information about institutional sponsorship, contact the Senior Editor Carl Raschke at [carl.raschke@du.edu](mailto:carl.raschke@du.edu).  If you have an article you would like to consider for publication, you need to submit **[](mailto:dianna.able@du.edu)**a 500-word abstract of the article along with a curriculum vitae to the [editor](mailto:carl.raschke@du.edu)[.](mailto:editor.jcrt@gmail.com.)   All articles must rigorously fit the mission of the JCRT (See Submissions Policy below).  No term papers, religious advocacy pieces, unsolicited book reviews or opinion pieces, etc. will be considered.  

Any redistribution or archiving of materials published in this journal is strictly prohibited without written permission from the publisher. Copyright for individual contributions are held by the author(s). Rights and permission to reproduce must be obtained by the author(s) and must acknowledge original publication in this journal.

**A Note on Open Source Publishing**

_The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory_ was established in 1999 as one of the true, early pioneers in electronic, open source publishing, and has been committed to that mission ever since.  Because of the ongoing commercialization of the internet during that same period, many once easily accessible print journals have increasingly been locked up behind high-priced, electronic subscription paywalls by international publishing conglomerates who have at the same time managed to corner the market on citation access and convince some university administrators that these kinds of publications are therefore more “credible” and “prestigious”, when in fact the opposite is often the case.  In addition, academic reputations are made by readers becoming widely familiar with published material, not by corporate publishers demanding exorbitant fees for simple access to one’s scholarly contributions.

## As a non-profit entity, we at the _Journal for Cultural and Religious_ _Theory_ believe that this unholy alliance between profit-oriented, commercial publishers, university administrators, and (by extension) tenure and promotion committees is unconscionable, and we do, and continue to, resist this invidious "neoliberal” trend in academic publishing.  We also invite our authors to resist it as well, and we are more than happy to provide letters of support to faculty to assure them that their submissions have been thoroughly peer-reviewed and chosen for their genuine quality.
